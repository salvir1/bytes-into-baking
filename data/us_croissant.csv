Make room in the refrigerator for a baking sheet. In step 6 and again in step 13, you will need room for 2 baking sheets.Cut the butter in four 1-Tablespoon pieces and place in the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment (or you can use a handheld mixer or no mixer, but a stand mixer is ideal). Add the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast. Turn the mixer on low-medium speed to gently combine the ingredients for 1 minute. With the mixer running, slowly pour in the milk. Once all of the milk is added, turn the mixer up to medium-high speed and beat the dough for at least 5 full minutes. (If you don’t have a mixer, knead by hand for 5 minutes.) The dough will be soft. It will (mostly) pull away from the sides of the bowl and if you poke it with your finger, it will bounce back. If after 5 minutes the dough is too sticky, keep the mixer running until it pulls away from the sides of the bowl.Remove dough from the bowl and, with floured hands, work it into a ball. Place the dough on a lightly floured silicone baking mat lined, lightly floured parchment paper lined, or lightly floured baking sheet. (I highly recommend a silicone baking mat because you can roll the dough out in the next step directly on top and it won’t slide all over the counter.) Gently flatten the dough out, as I do in the video above, and cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and allow the covered dough to rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.Remove the dough from the refrigerator. I like to keep the dough on the silicone baking mat when I’m rolling it in this step because the mat is nonstick and it’s a handy guide for the exact measurement. Begin flattening out the dough with your hands. You’re rolling it out into a rectangle in this step, so shaping it with your hands first helps the stretchy dough. Roll it into a 14&#215;10-inch rectangle. The dough isn&#8217;t extremely cold after only 30 minutes in the refrigerator, so it will feel more like soft play-doh. Be precise with the measurement. The dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working the edges with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct size rectangle.Place the rolled out dough back onto the baking sheet (this is why I prefer a silicone baking mat or parchment because you can easily transfer the dough). Cover the rolled out dough with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and allow the covered dough to rest in the refrigerator for 4 hours or overnight. (Up to 24 hours is ok.)In a large bowl using a hand-held mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and flour together until smooth and combined. Transfer the mixture to a silicone baking mat lined or parchment paper lined baking sheet. (Silicone baking mat is preferred because you can easily peel the butter off in the next step.) Using a spoon or small spatula, smooth out into a 7&#215;10-inch rectangle. Be as precise as you can with this measurement. Place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and chill the butter layer for 30 minutes. (No need to cover it for only 30 minutes.) You want the butter layer firm, but still pliable. If it gets too firm, let it sit out on the counter for a few minutes to gently soften. The more firm the butter layer is the more difficult it will be to laminate the dough in the next step. In this next step, you will be rolling out the dough into a large rectangle. Do this on a lightly floured counter instead of rolling out on your silicone baking mat. The counter is typically a little cooler (great for keeping the dough cold) and the silicone baking mat is smaller than the measurement you need. Remove both the dough and butter layers from the refrigerator. Place the butter layer in the center of the dough and fold each end of the dough over it. If the butter wasn’t an exact 7&#215;10-inch rectangle, use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to even out the edges. Seal the dough edges over the butter layer as best you can with your fingers. On a lightly floured counter, roll the dough into a 10&#215;20-inch rectangle. It’s best to roll back and forth with the shorter end of the dough facing you, like I do in the video above. Use your fingers if you need to. The dough is very cold, so it will take a lot of arm muscle to roll. Again, the dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working it with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct size rectangle. Fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter. This was the 1st turn.If the dough is now too warm to work with, place folded dough on the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 30 minutes before the 2nd turn. I usually don’t have to. Turn the dough so the short end is facing you. Roll the dough out once again into a 10&#215;20-inch rectangle, then fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter. The dough must be refrigerated between the 2nd and 3rd turn because it has been worked with a lot by this point. Place the folded dough on the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 30 minutes before the 3rd turn.Roll the dough out once again into a 10&#215;20-inch rectangle. Fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter.Place the folded dough on the lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight. (Up to 24 hours is ok.)At the end of the next step, you’ll need 2 baking sheets lined with silicone baking mats or parchment paper. The dough is currently on a lined baking sheet in the refrigerator, so you already have 1 prepared!Remove the dough from the refrigerator. On a lightly floured counter, roll the dough out into an 8&#215;20-inch rectangle. Use your fingers if you need to. Once again, the dough is very cold, so it will take a lot of arm muscle to roll. The dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working it with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct size rectangle. Using a pizza cutter or sharp knife, slice the dough in half vertically. Each skinny rectangle will be 4-inches wide. Then cut 3 even slices horizontally, yielding 8 4&#215;5-inch rectangles. See photo and video above for a visual. Cut each rectangle diagonally to make 2 triangles. You have 16 triangles now. Work with one triangle at a time. Using your fingers or a rolling pin, stretch the triangle to be about 8 inches long. Do this gently as you do not want to flatten the layers. Cut a small slit at the wide end of the triangle, then tightly roll up into a crescent shape making sure the tip is underneath. Slightly bend the ends in towards each other. Repeat with remaining dough, placing the shaped croissants on 2 lined baking sheets, 8 per sheet. Loosely cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and allow to rest at room temperature (no warmer! I suggest just keeping on the counter) for 1 hour, then place in the refrigerator to rest for 1 hour or up to 12 hours. (Or freeze, see freezing instructions.) I prefer the shaped croissants to be cold going into the oven. When you poke the dough with your finger, it will slowly bounce back. That means they are ready to be baked.Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C).Whisk the egg wash ingredients together. Remove the croissants from the refrigerator. Brush each lightly with egg wash. Bake until croissants are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Rotate the pans halfway through baking. If croissants show signs of darkening too quickly, reduce the oven to 375°F (190°C).Remove croissants from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool for a few minutes before serving. They will slightly deflate as they cool.Croissants taste best the same day they’re baked. Cover any leftover croissants and store at room temperature for a few days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. You can also freeze for up to 3 months, then thaw on the counter or overnight in the refrigerator. Warm up to your liking.",croissant

Add 1 tablespoon of the sugar, 3 cups (362g) of the flour, and the yeast. Mix until well blended; set aside to let the sponge work., For the butter: Cut the butter into 1˝ chunks and combine with the salt and flour at low speed in a stand mixer just until smooth, with no lumps. Be careful not to beat too much; you don’t want to incorporate any air., Spread the butter on a piece of plastic wrap and shape into an 8˝ square. Wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes., Finish the dough: Add the melted butter to the sponge. Whisk together the remaining sugar, 2 1/2 cups (298g) of the flour, the dry milk, and salt and add to the sponge. Mix until the dough forms. Knead for 5 minutes; touch the dough lightly with your finger. If it’s still sticky, add the remaining flour 2 tablespoons at a time until the dough is the desired consistency. Once the dough is smooth and elastic, pat it into a 9˝ square, then wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes., To laminate the dough: Remove the chilled dough from the refrigerator and gently roll it to a 12"" square., Unwrap the butter square and place it in the center of the dough at a 45° angle, so it looks like a diamond in a square. Pull the corners of the dough into the center of the butter diamond. Moisten the edges with a little water and pinch the seams together well to enclose the butter. Dust the top with flour and turn the packet over., Tap the dough all over with a rolling pin, encouraging it into a rectangular shape. Once it’s pliable, roll it to a 20˝ x 10˝ rectangle, picking it up and dusting lightly with flour as needed., When you’ve reached the proper size, use a dry brush to sweep off any excess flour and fold the dough in thirds, like a business letter. Take care to keep the edges straight and line them up directly over each other. If the dough slides around, use a little water at the corners to tack them in place. This is your first turn., Rotate the dough out so it looks like a book about to be opened. Roll the dough out once more to 20˝ x 10˝ and fold it as before. This is the second turn. Wrap the dough and refrigerate it for 30 minutes to allow the gluten in the dough to relax., Give the dough two more turns after its rest, then wrap the dough well and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight before using. You can also freeze the dough at this point., To shape the croissants: Cut the packet of dough in half. Wrap and refrigerate or freeze one half., Roll the other half to a 13˝ x 18˝ rectangle. Trim the edges about 1/4˝ all the way around with a ruler and pizza cutter. This removes the folded edges that would inhibit the dough’s rise., Cut the dough in thirds lengthwise and in half down the center. This will give you six 4˝ x 9˝ pieces. Cut these pieces in half diagonally and arrange them so the points are facing away from you. Stretch them gently to make them a little longer, then cut a 1˝ notch in the center of the base of each triangle., Take the two inside corners of the notch and roll them up toward you, building a curved shape as you roll the base of the dough toward the tip. Make sure the tip ends up under the bottom of the croissant. Place the shaped pastry on a parchment-lined baking sheet, curving the ends toward each other. Refrigerate for 30 minutes., Take the croissants out of the refrigerator, and let them warm and rise for 60 to 90 minutes at room temperature. They should expand noticeably, and when you gently press one with your finger, the indentation should remain., Towards the end of the rise time, preheat the oven to 425°F. Brush each croissant with an egg beaten with 1 tablespoon water. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven’s temperature to 350°F and bake for 10 to 15 minutes more, until deep golden brown and no raw dough is visible where the layers overlap. Remove from the oven and let cool on the pan on a rack for 20 minutes before serving.",croissant

With this recipe we want to give you the exact directions on how we go about making classic French croissants. The recipe is an adaptation from the recipe for Classic Croissants by Jeffrey Hamelman. We started out largely following the instructions for his recipe, changed everything to our beloved metric system and found out some worthwhile croissant knowledge of our own along the way. Hopefully enough to justify sharing it all with you and inspiring you to give croissant baking a shot yourself. 
Before you start we can recommend watching our croissant making video to get a general feel for the recipe. You can also check out our croissant making log where we keep track of our own croissant baking adventures. For answers to your croissant questions you can check out the Frequently Asked Croissant Questions section.
This recipe will yield about 15 good croissants plus some leftover bits which you can use to make a few, slightly odd shaped ones, or other inventive croissant-like creations.  
If at first you don’t succeed, maybe you can take comfort from the fact that our first efforts were not very ‘croissant worthy’. But as you can see we persevered and got better…But we have to admit it is and always will be a tricky process. You have to work precise and be focused to get good results. So away with screaming children, hyperactive animals and all other things distracting! Put on some appropriate croissant making music and lets get to it…    
Please read the following tips;
There is no way to hide little mistakes in your technique when making croissants. Do not expect to get perfect croissants the very first time you try our recipe, most people need to make them 3 to 4 times to get the general feeling for the process. There is no substitute for practice and experience. But best of all and most important, enjoy the process!
Please try this recipe exactly as written down at least 3 times before starting experimenting with spelt, freezing, retarding, margarine, timing, sourdough etc. If you can make a croissant resembling the ones you see in the pictures you are ready for the next step. Learn to walk before you try to run!
Every type / brand of flour and butter type also makes a difference. Try a few flours to find the one in your area which hits the balance between strength and flexibility. The same with butter, it needs to be pliable but not too soft. We use an organic butter with a low water content. A higher water content tends to make butter hard, which promotes tearing and breaking and ruins the layers. The butter we use has written on the package ‘at least 82%’ butterfat’. So please if possible use the right butter!









































According to Raymond Calvel croissants laminated with margarine are formed into the crescent shape, while croissants laminated with butter are left in the straight form. We say, use whichever shape you like best, but do use butter!
The croissant recipe


Ingredients for the croissant dough

500 g  French Type 55 flour or unbleached all-purpose flour / plain flour (extra for dusting)
140 g water
140 g whole milk (you can take it straight from the fridge)
55 g sugar
40 g soft unsalted butter
11 g instant yeast
12 g salt



Other ingredients
makes 15

280 g cold unsalted butter for laminating
1 egg + 1 tsp water for the egg wash 


First time croissant baker? Choose a cold day with a room temperature below 20 ºC / 68 ºF . This way you will have more time for the whole process and less chance of your precious butter being absorbed by the dough. The key is to keep the butter solid between the layers of dough, this is what gives the croissant its flaky layers.
Day 1
Making the croissant dough
We usually do this part in the evening. Combine the dough ingredients and knead for 3 minutes, at low to medium speed, until the dough comes together and you’ve reached the stage of low to moderate gluten development. You do not want too much gluten development because you will struggle with the dough fighting back during laminating. Shape the dough like a disc, not a ball, before you refrigerate it, so it will be easier to roll it into a square shape the following day. Place the disc on a plate, cover with clingfilm and leave in the fridge overnight.  



































Day 2
Laminating the dough
Cut the cold butter (directly from the fridge) lengthwise into 1,25 cm thick slabs. Arrange the pieces of butter on waxed paper to form a square of about 15 cm x 15 cm. Cover the butter with another layer of waxed paper and with a rolling pin pound butter until it’s about 19 cm x 19 cm. Trim / straighten the edges of the butter and put the trimmings on top of the square. Now pound lightly until you have a final square of 17 cm x 17 cm. Wrap in paper and refrigerate the butter slab until needed. 
Use just enough flour on your work surface to prevent the dough from sticking. However keep the amount to a minimum, otherwise too much flour will be incorporated between the layers and this will show in the end result.










































Take the dough out of the fridge. With a rolling pin roll out the dough disc into a 26 cm x 26 cm square. Try to get the square as perfect as possible and with an even thickness. Get the slab of butter from the fridge. Place the dough square so one of the sides of the square is facing you and place the butter slab on it with a 45 degree angle to the dough so a point of the butter square is facing you. Fold a flap of dough over the butter, so the point of the dough reaches the center of the butter. Do the same with the three other flaps. The edges of the dough flaps should slightly overlap to fully enclose the butter. With the palm of your hand lightly press the edges to seal the seams. 

Now the dough with the sealed in butter needs to be rolled out. With a lightly floured rolling pin start rolling out, on a lightly flour dusted surface, the dough to a rectangle of 20 x 60 cm. Start rolling from the center of the dough towards the edges, and not from one side of the dough all the way to the other side. This technique helps you to keep the dough at an even thickness. You can also rotate your dough 180 degrees to keep it more even, because you tend to use more pressure when rolling away from you than towards yourself. You can use these techniques during all the rolling steps of this recipe. Aim at lengthening the dough instead of making it wider and try to keep all edges as straight as possible. 
Fold the dough letter style, cover with clingfilm and refrigerate for 30 minutes (fold one third of the dough on top of itself and then fold the other side over it). Repeat the rolling and folding two more times (ending up with 27 layers of butter in total), each time rolling until the dough is about 20 cm x 60 cm. After each fold you should turn the dough 90 degrees before rolling again. The open ‘end’ of the dough should be towards you every time when rolling out the dough (you can see this in our croissant making video at around 3:40 minutes). After the second turn, again give it a 30 minute rest in the fridge. After the third turn you leave the dough in the fridge overnight until day 3, the actual croissant making day!
Sometimes the dough will resist to get any longer than for example 45 cm, stop rolling and pressing the dough, it will only hurt your layers. At any stage when the rolling of the dough gets harder you can cover the dough and let the gluten relax for 10 to 20 minutes in the fridge before continuing.

Each laminating step should not take more than a few minutes. However if, due to initial inexperience for example, it should take you longer, you can fold your dough letter style, cover it and refrigerate it for 20 minutes and continue the rolling process after this rest. It is very important the butter stays solid.

Day 3
Dividing the dough
Take the dough from the fridge. Lightly flour your work surface. Now very gently roll the dough into a long and narrow strip of 20 cm x 110 cm. If the dough starts to resist too much or shrink back during this process you can fold it in thirds and give it a rest in the fridge for 10 to 20 minutes before continuing. Do not fight the dough, when the dough refuses to get any longer, rest it in the fridge! It is such a shame to ruin two days of work.
When your dough has reached its intended shape, carefully lift it a few centimeters to allow it to naturally shrink back from both sides. This way it will not shrink when you cut it. Your strip of dough should be long enough to allow you to trim the ends to make them straight and still be left with a length of about 100 cm.   









































Shaping the croissants
For the next stage you will need a tape measure and a pizza wheel. Lay a tape measure along the top of the dough. With the wheel you mark the top of the dough at 12,5 cm intervals along the length (7 marks total). Now lay the tape measure along the bottom of the dough and make a mark at 6,25 cm. Then continue to make marks at 12,5 cm intervals from this point (8 marks total). So the bottom and the top marks do not align with each other and form the basis for your triangles.
Now make diagonal cuts starting from the top corner cutting down to the first bottom mark. Make diagonal cuts along the entire length of the dough. Then change the angle and make cuts from the other top corner to the bottom mark to create triangles. Again repeat this along the length of the dough. This way you will end up with 15 triangles and a few end pieces of dough. 

Using your pizza wheel, make 1.5 cm long notches in the center of the short side of each dough triangle. 
Now very gently elongate each triangle to about 25 cm. This is often done by hand, but we have found that elongating with a rolling pin, very carefully, almost without putting pressure on the dough triangle, works better for us. You can try both methods and see what you think gives the best result. 
After you cut a notch in the middle of the short end of the triangle, try and roll the two wings by moving your hands outwards from the center, creating the desired shape with a thinner, longer point. Also try and roll the dough very tightly at the beginning and put enough pressure on the dough to make the layers stick together (but not so much as to damage the layers of course).  

Proofing and baking
Arrange the shaped croissants on baking sheets, making sure to keep enough space between them so they will not touch when proofing and baking. Combine the egg with a teaspoon of water and whisk until smooth. Give the croissants their first thin coating of egg wash. 
Proof the croissants draft-free at an ideal temperature of 24ºC to 26.5ºC / 76ºF to 79ºF (above that temperature there is a big chance butter will leak out!). We use our small Rofco B20 stone oven as a croissant proofing cabinet by preheating it for a minute to 25ºC / 77ºF. It retains this temperature for a long time because of the oven stones and isolation. The proofing should take about 2 hours. You should be able to tell if they are ready by carefully shaking the baking sheet and see if the croissants slightly wiggle. You should also be able to see the layers of dough when looking at your croissants from the side. 









































Preheat the oven at 200ºC / 390ºF convection or 220ºC / 430ºF conventional oven.

Right before baking, give the croissants their second thin coat of egg wash. We bake the croissants in our big convection oven for 6 minutes at 195ºC / 385ºF, then lowering the temperature to 165ºC / 330ºF, and bake them for another 9 minutes. Hamelman suggest baking the croissants for 18 to 20 minutes at 200ºC / 390ºF , turning your oven down a notch if you think the browning goes too quickly. But you really have to learn from experience and by baking several batches what the ideal time and temperature is for your own oven. Take out of the oven, leave for a few minutes on the baking sheet, then transfer to a cooling rack.
Latest way of baking; We heat up our double fan big convection oven at 200ºC, when heated up put the croissants in the oven and directly lower it to 175ºC. We bake them for 10 minutes at 175ºC, they will have a nice brown color by now, then lower the temperature to 150ºC, and bake them for another 6 minutes.
Best eaten while warm and fresh of course. Croissant we don’t eat or share within a day we freeze. We put them in the preheated oven (180ºC / 355ºF) for 8 minutes straight from the freezer. Nothing wrong with that, croissants eaten nice and warm, almost as good as the fresh ones…almost!
We used the excess dough we trimmed from the edges to make, a bit odd shaped but still very delicious, ‘pain au chocolat’, using our favorite Valrhona Caraïbe dark chocolate. The trimmed dough parts are still worth using, it would be a shame to throw them away!

4,https://www.finecooking.com/recipe/classic-croissants,"Combine all of the dough ingredients in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Mix on low speed for 3 minutes, scraping the sides of the mixing bowl once if necessary. Mix on medium speed for 3 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured 10-inch pie pan or a dinner plate. Lightly flour the top of the dough and wrap well with plastic so it doesn’t dry out. Refrigerate overnight.The next day, cut the cold butter lengthwise into 1/2-inch-thick slabs. Arrange the pieces on a piece of parchment or waxed paper to form a 5- to 6-inch square, cutting the butter crosswise as necessary to fit. Top with another piece of parchment or waxed paper. With a rolling pin, pound the butter with light, even strokes. As the pieces begin to adhere, use more force. Pound the butter until it’s about 7-1/2 inches square and then trim the edges of the butter. Put the trimmings on top of the square and pound them in lightly with the rolling pin. Refrigerate while you roll out the dough.Unwrap and lay the dough on a lightly floured work surface. Roll into a 10-1/2-inch square. Brush excess flour off the dough. Remove the butter from the refrigerator—it should be pliable but cold. If not, refrigerate a bit longer. Unwrap and place the butter on the dough so that the points of the butter square are centered along the sides of the dough. Fold one flap of dough over the butter toward you, stretching it slightly so that the point just reaches the center of the butter. Repeat with the other flaps . Then press the edges together to completely seal the butter inside the dough. (A complete seal ensures butter won’t escape.)Lightly flour the top and bottom of the dough. With the rolling pin, firmly press the dough to elongate it slightly and then begin rolling instead of pressing, focusing on lengthening rather than widening the dough and keeping the edges straight.Roll the dough until it’s 8 by 24 inches. If the ends lose their square shape, gently reshape the corners with your hands. Brush any flour off the dough. Pick up one short end of the dough and fold it back over the dough, leaving one-third of the other end of dough exposed. Brush the flour off and then fold the exposed dough over the folded side. Put the dough on a baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and freeze for 20 minutes to relax and chill the dough.Repeat the rolling and folding, this time rolling in the direction of the two open ends until the dough is about 8 by 24 inches. Fold the dough in thirds again, as shown in the photo above, brushing off excess flour and turning under any rounded edges or short ends with exposed or smeared layers. Cover and freeze for another 20 minutes.Give the dough a third rolling and folding. Put the dough on the baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap, tucking the plastic under all four sides. Refrigerate overnight.The next day, unwrap and lightly flour the top and bottom of the dough. With the rolling pin, “wake the dough up” by pressing firmly along its length—you don’t want to widen the dough but simply begin to lengthen it with these first strokes. Roll the dough into a long and narrow strip, 8 inches by about 44 inches. If the dough sticks as you roll, sprinkle with flour. Once the dough is about half to two-thirds of its final length, it may start to resist rolling and even shrink back. If this happens, fold the dough in thirds, cover, and refrigerate for about 10 minutes; then unfold the dough and finish rolling. Lift the dough an inch or so off the table at its midpoint and allow it to shrink from both sides—this helps prevent the dough from shrinking when it’s cut. Check that there’s enough excess dough on either end to allow you to trim the ends so they’re straight and the strip of dough is 40 inches long. Trim the dough.Lay a yardstick or tape measure lengthwise along the top of the dough. With a knife, mark the top of the dough at 5-inch intervals along the length (there will be 7 marks in all). Position the yardstick along the bottom of the dough. Make a mark 2-1/2 inches in from the end of the dough. Make marks at 5-inch intervals from this point all along the bottom of the dough. You’ll have 8 marks that fall halfway between the marks at the top.Make diagonal cuts by positioning the yardstick at the top corner and the first bottom mark. With a knife or pizza wheel, cut the dough along this line. Move the yardstick to the next set of marks and cut. Repeat until you have cut the dough diagonally at the same angle along its entire length—you’ll have made 8 cuts. Now change the angle of the yardstick to connect the other top corner and bottom mark and cut the dough along this line to make triangles. Repeat along the entire length of dough. You’ll end up with 15 triangles and a small scrap of dough at each end.Using a paring knife or a bench knife, make a 1/2- to 3/4-inch-long notch in the center of the short side of each triangle. The notch helps the rolled croissant curl into a crescent. Hold a dough triangle so that the short notched side is on top and gently elongate to about 10 inches without squeezing or compressing the dough—this step results in more layers and loft.Lay the croissant on the work surface with the notched side closest to you. With one hand on each side of the notch, begin to roll the dough away from you, towards the pointed end.Flare your hands outward as you roll so that the “legs” become longer. Press down on the dough with enough force to make the layers stick together, but avoid excess compression, which could smear the layers. Roll the dough all the way down its length until the pointed end of the triangle is directly underneath the croissant. Now bend the two legs towards you to form a tight crescent shape and gently press the tips of the legs together (they’ll come apart while proofing but keep their crescent shape).Shape the remaining croissants in the same manner, arranging them on two large parchment-lined rimmed baking sheets (8 on one pan and 7 on the other). Keep as much space as possible between them, as they will rise during the final proofing and again when baked.Make the egg wash by whisking the egg with 1 tsp. water in a small bowl until very smooth. Lightly brush it on each croissant.Refrigerate the remaining egg wash (you’ll need it again). Put the croissants in a draft-free spot at 75° to 80°F. Wherever you proof them, be sure the temperature is not so warm that the butter melts out of the dough. They will take 1-1/2 to 2 hours to fully proof. You’ll know they’re ready if you can see the layers of dough when the croissants are viewed from the side, and if you shake the sheets, the croissants will wiggle. Finally, the croissants will be distinctly larger (though not doubled) than they were when first shaped.Shortly before the croissants are fully proofed, position racks in the top and lower thirds of the oven and heat it to 400°F convection, or 425°F conventional. Brush the croissants with egg wash a second time. Put the sheets in the oven. After 10 minutes, rotate the sheets and swap their positions. Continue baking until the bottoms are an even brown, the tops richly browned, and the edges show signs of coloring, another 8 to 10 minutes. If they appear to be darkening too quickly during baking, lower the oven temperature by 10°F. Let cool on baking sheets on racks.",croissant
5,https://www.jocooks.com/recipes/homemade-croissants/,"Bloom the yeast: In the bowl of a mixer, add the warm milk, brown sugar, yeast and stir it with a fork slightly. Let it stand for about 5 minutes. If the yeast is good, the mixture will get all foamy as the yeast dissolves. It could take a bit longer but if your yeast does not dissolve, see recipe notes.Make the dough: Add the flour and salt to the bowl. Using the dough hook, mix on low speed for about 5 minutes until the dough is smooth and very soft. I used about 3 1/4 cups of flour, but if you need more because the dough is too sticky than just add more, about 1 tbsp at a time. You might want to start with 3 cups and add as needed. Remove the dough from the mixing bowl and knead for a couple more minutes on your working surface. The dough needs to be soft and slightly sticky. Place the dough back in the bowl, wrap it with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for an hour.Prepare the butter: While the dough is chilling, prepare the butter. Arrange the sticks of butter horizontally on a piece of plastic wrap. Cover the butter with another piece of plastic wrap. Pound and roll out on both sides until the butter forms a nice 8 by 5 inch rectangle. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use.&nbsp;Laminate the dough: Flour your work surface lightly then roll out the dough into a big rectangle that's about 16 by 10 inches. Place the butter directly in the center of the dough and fold the dough as you would a letter, bottom third of dough over butter, then top third down over the dough. If you have any excess flour, make sure you brush that off.Turn the dough so that the short side is nearest you and start rolling it another 16 by 10 inch rectangle. Fold in thirds like a letter again. This was the first fold. Wrap it up in plastic wrap and chill it for another hour.Repeat as above. With the short side near you, start rolling until you get another 16 by 10 inch rectangle. Fold it in thirds again, wrap and chill for another hour. Repeat this 3 more times so that it will make a total of 5 folds. After the last fold, refrigerate it over night or at least for 8 hours.Shape croissants: Cut the dough in half, freeze half if you're only going to use half of it. Roll out each piece of dough into a long rectangle, so that it's about 1/4 of an inch in thickness. I found it easier if I cut the piece into 3 pieces, so that I work with 3 squares. Using a pizza cutter, cut each square into 4 triangles.Using one triangle at a time, start rolling from the wide side, at the same time, stretching the end of the triangle. Continue rolling the croissant, and as you'll notice because you stretched into a long piece, you'll be able to roll the croissant a few times.Repeat this with remaining dough and place the croissants on an ungreased baking sheet, with about 1 to 2 inches in between them.Let the croissants sit for another hour, you'll notice they'll rise a bit, then brush them with egg wash. You can make the croissants ahead of time and refrigerate them for up to 18 hours before baking. If you're making them ahead, make sure to cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap.Bake croissants: Preheat your oven to 400 F degrees. Place the baking sheet in the oven and bake the croissants for 8 to 12 minutes at 400 F degrees then turn down the heat to 375 F degrees and bake them for another 8 to 12 minutes. You want to make sure they are nice and golden brown.",croissant

Croissants are just one of those things where you will never fully appreciate one when you eat it, until you’ve put in the hours making them yourself.
They aren’t incredibly difficult but they really are a labour of love!
Once you’ve got the method of handling the dough down, you basically just need good time-keeping and patience for successful croissant dough.
I always find it SO HARD to concentrate on long recipe instructions, so normally end up ‘ad libbing’ my way through them based on instinct; but when it comes to French baked goods (macarons, puff pastry, croissants) there is just no way you can make that shiz up.
I dunno if other people feel the same way, but I decided to make you all another .gif guide, so that if like me, you too hate to read super long recipes, at least you have some moving pictures to guide you along.
And it’s worth it, look, they are SO PRETTY 😀

That’s why I’ve made an extra post here, where you can see more photos (yeah, I literally just put a post up containing only croissant photos because I am a cray face)
Yup im going to write it again, real big incase you’re skim reading this:
CLICK HERE FOR MORE PHOTOS OF THE PRETTY, PRETTY CROISSANTAYS.

 
Ugh, I hope you enjoy this.
p.s. Also, by some super strange coinky dink, my friend Erica has also done a croissant tutorial (her’s seems easier than my method tbh) I think we must have a psychic food connection haha 🙂

Recipe + Method adapted from Nancy Silverton via Gourmet, here, here and here
 To make the dough:
1 cup (250 ml) cold milk (I used 2%)
1/2 cup (125 ml) boiling water
1 tbsp active dry yeast
1/4 cup (50 g) sugar
3 3/4 cup (500 g) all purpose flour
1 tsp salt
1 cup + 2tbsp (9 oz/ 250 g) butter, frozen, then left at room temp. for 20-30 minutes
 
1. Pour the milk and boiling water into a large bowl. Stir in the yeast and sugar, leave for 5 minutes until frothy.
2. Add in the flour and salt, incorporate it with your hands into a shaggy ball.

 
3. Tip the contents out onto a clean work surface and knead until you’ve incorporated all the flour (this should only take about 2 minutes). Place the dough into an oiled bowl, and leave in the fridge to rest for 1 hour.

 
3. When your dough has been in the fridge for 30 minutes, take your frozen butter (which has been left at room temperature for 20-30 minutes), and grate onto a piece of cling film (aka plastic wrap)

 
4. Disperse the butter, and flatten into a rectangle, roughly 8″ x 5″. Fold up in the cling film and pat together well (seriously, like make sure it’s nicely compacted).  Refrigerate for 30 minutes.

 
5. Once the butter has been chilling for 25 minutes (cos he’s a cool dude, you know), tip the chilled dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and roll into a 16″ x 10″ rectangle.

6. Unwrap the chilled butter block and place into the centre of the dough. Fold the dough into thirds over the butter (like a business letter). Seal all the edges by pinching the dough together.

 
7. Rotate the dough 90 degrees, use the roiling pin to make regular indentations in the dough.

8. Roll into a 15″ x 10″ rectangle.
 
9. Fold into thirds like a business letter. Wrap the dough in cling film, and refrigerate for 1 hour.  (steps 8+9 = ‘one turn’ of the dough)

 
10. Remove the dough from the fridge, unwrap and complete 1 turn (i.e. repeat steps 8 + 9). Re-wrap in the cling film, refrigerate for 1 hour.
11. Repeat step 10, two more times, so you have done a total of 4 turns.
12. Cut the dough into quarters. Wrap the quarters tightly in cling film and refrigerate for 8-12 hours, or freeze for up to 3 months (if you freeze it, let the dough defrost in the fridge overnight before shaping).

Shaping the dough
Remove one piece of dough from the fridge, unwrap it, and roll out on a lightly floured surface into a 16″ x 6″ rectangle.
Cut into thirds, forming 3 smaller rectangles. Cut each of these rectangles in half diagonally forming 6 triangles.
 

Take one triangle of dough (I recommend putting the others in the fridge while you shape each one).
Pull on the corners of the shortest edge, to even up the base of the triangle. Then gently stretch the dough a little

Cut a small slit in the base of the triangle, stretch it, then roll the dough up.

 
Place it, tip side down, onto a lined cookie sheet. Repeat with the rest of the triangles, placing them 2″ apart.
(at this point you can also freeze the shaped croissants on the baking sheet, then once frozen, transfer them to a plastic bag and leave in the freezer for up to 3 months, then defrost in the fridge overnight and proceed as below).
Bake: 
Cover loosely with cling film and leave to rise in a cool place for around 2-3 hours ( if you’re making these the night before, you can actually shape them and leave them to rise in the fridge overnight instead).
Once ready to bake, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (22o degrees C) . Brush the croissants with beaten egg using a pastry brush and put into the oven. Immediately lower the temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), and bake for 10 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) and bake for a further 10-15 minutes until well browned and puffy.
Let cool on a wire rack. Enjoy your 2 to I-literally-don’t-know-how-long-these-took-to-make-any-more day labour of love.

7,https://gourmetier.com/french-croissants/,"The preparation of the croissants consists of two main phases: the initial dough, called détrempe, and the laminating, which consists of integrating the butter to the détrempe, forming alternate layers.
The difficulty in making croissants at home lies in manually creating thin and even layers of dough/butter in order to achieve a product with good volume and an open, honey-comb texture.

Tools
For making the dough and shaping the butter:

Clingfilm and freezer bag. It is important to correctly wrap the détrempe (and then the dough) in clingfilm and then put it inside a freezer bag to prevent it from drying out. It will also protect the dough against possible unpleasant smells inside the refrigerator.
Waxed paper, pencil and ruler. To give butter the right shape in order to work with precision.

For laminating:

Cold tray. Before rolling, place a tray (better if steel or marble) inside the freezer so you can place in it croissants once cut and keep them cold before shaping.
Ice blocks. To keep the work surface cool at all times.
Rolling pin. I use a stainless steel rolling pin because it has several advantages: it is non-stick and it’s heavy, so it saves me effort when handling some doughs. However, its weight can also be a disadvantage, especially if you have no experience in laminating. In fact, when we have no experience we usually tend to apply too much pressure on the rolling pin during laminating. So if we use a heavy rolling pin like the stainless steel one we may break the layers. Therefore, I do not recommend that you specifically buy this kind of rolling pin. If you already have it, it’s great but if not, a standard wooden rolling pin is perfectly fine. Once you have more experience in laminating, the stainless rolling pin is quite useful.
Brush. The brush will allow us to remove the excess flour without damaging the dough.
Infrared thermometer. It’s a necessary tool to control the temperature of the dough at all times. It’s cheap and very practical.
Sharp knife or pizza steel. To trim the edges of the dough during laminating, and to precisely divide the croissants before shaping them.


Important notes on the ingredients
1. What flour should we use to make croissants?
Choosing the right flour is very important to get croissants with the right volume and texture. As you can imagine, not all flours can be used. When choosing the flour, you have to check some technical data: baking strength, elasticity/tenacity ratio (P/L) and the protein percentage.
– Baking strength: choose a strong flour, which allows to develop gluten during kneading, but also during rolling. The strength of the flour is measured by the W factor. A strong flour has a factor that ranges between W320 and W380.
– P/L: the flour you choose not only has to be strong, but it has to maintain this strength over time, that is, during proofing and baking. The factor that determines the relationship between force and time is called «P/L» (i.e., elasticity & tenacity). The flour used for croissant should have a good P/L ratio to avoid the dough fighting back during laminating (between 0.4 and 0.7 approx., the higher this value is, the less elasticity the flour presents).
– Proteins: the percentage of proteins (i.e. gluten) goes hand in hand with the baking strength. The more strength, the more protein. It is very important that the flour you use is rich in proteins (between 13% and 15%), since the good development of the croissants depends to a large extent on it.
To these three factors, I would add the water absorption power of the flour. It is difficult to measure it and you will have to try it by yourself. The hydration rate of the détrempe will depend on this factor (a flour that has a high water absorption power will need more hydration).
I usually use two flours that meet these characteristics: Lievitati flour (W350-370 – P / L 0.48 / 0.50 – Proteins> 13%) and flour Sfoglia (W300-320 – P / L 0.48 / 0.50 – Proteins> 13%), both from Molino Pasini. Like most specific flours they are not easy to find in regular stores and are usually sold in bags of 10 or 25 kg. Some of these flours are available online.

2. Yeast, sourdough, preferment: which is the best way to ferment the croissants?
Croissants can be fermented using various methods, the three main ones being: yeast (direct method), a mix of preferment (poolish) and yeast, or a combination of sourdough and yeast.
Sourdough
If you do not have experience making croissants at home, I would not recommend to start using sourdough. Besides adding complexity to the process (a more precise organization and a greater control of the proofing phase), its use requires a fairly rigorous control of the sourness, especially if, like me, you do not use your sourdough daily and it stays weeks in the fridge. If the breads we bake can have a mildly sour taste, croissants cannot so we have to make sure that the sourdough we use to make croissants is not sour at all.
After many tests, I think it’s not that worth to use sourdough in the croissant formula. When I started making croissants at home, I used part of sourdough (30%) and a small amount of dry yeast (since making decent croissants using only sourdough is almost impossible, even for professional bakers), but it did not end to achieve the expected results with this combination: my croissants lacked a little volume and I didn’t get the texture I expected.
There is a certain obsession with sourdough among home bakers (including myself!). The use of sourdough is essential for many breads, as it provides a special texture and helps extending the lifespan of the product (as in the case of Panettone, for example). However, a croissant is prepared for immediate consumption and, in this case, sourdough barely provides benefits in terms of texture and flavor. Of course you get great croissants using a part of sourdough (and as a personal challenge it’s fine!) but I personally achieved better results using fresh yeast.
Preferment
Some bakers (like Chad Roberston from Tartine), use poolish in their formula, a liquid preferment made with the same proportion of flour and water, and with a pinch of yeast (between 0.1% and 0,3%). It is usually prepared on the eve so that it ferments between 8 and 16 hours, and bakers usually use between 30% and 40% over the total weight of the flour of the détrempe.
In theory, poolish allows to achieve a greater extensibility of the détrempe, which helps to better laminate the dough. Personally, I do not like this method as I think it brings more moisture to the dough, which forces us to have more control over hydration.
Some bakers also add a proportion of pâte fermentée («fermented dough», that is to say of previous détrempe) or even cuts of croissant dough in order to fully develop the croissant aromas; however I do not recommend it because it alters the formula (increasing the proportion of all ingredients, including yeast) and, consequently, proofing times.
Dry yeast or fresh yeast?
The best option for me (at least to begin with) is to use yeast.
I have tried both types of yeast (fresh and dry). At first I used dry yeast. However, I have stopped using it for several reasons. Firstly because it contains additives. Secondly because fermentation is slower and more difficult to control. And finally, I find it difficult to check the quality and condition of the dry yeast, since some of it has been packed for a long time and lose a lot of strength.
In my opinion, the best option for making homemade croissants is to use only fresh yeast. It is easy to find and its use is very practical.
Some advices when using fresh yeast.
I buy it from one of the bakeries in my neighborhood. They sell it to the weight and they usually receive it daily so I know it is very fresh and of great quality. But you can use perfectly the one sold in supermarkets.
– Look carefully at the expiration date. Before using it, smell it: if it smells very strong or rancid throw it away.
– Do not freeze it: the bacteria it contains will end up dying.
– Keep it wrapped in cling film inside a tightly closed glass jar to prevent it from drying out and consume it quickly.
3. Why is sugar important in fermented doughs?
In addition to providing flavor and color (favoring caramelization), sugar is part of the food for yeast. Bear in mind that during proofing, yeast consumes part of the sugars. The other part stays in the dough. Therefore, if we do not add sugar or use too little, our croissants will not ferment properly and will lose color and texture. Also keep in mind that sugar absorbs part of the moisture of the dough, so you have to adjust the amount of water depending on the amount of sugar.
Croissants usually carry between 8% and 15% sugar. You can use different kinds of sugars such as panela, coconut sugar, brown sugar, etc., taking into account that they will provide a different color and flavor to the final product. However, it is not advisable to use sweeteners (both liquid and granulated), since they have a greater sweetening power which would modify the texture and flavor.
4. Is it better to use water or milk?
At first I only used water (and a very small amount of milk powder). However, according to several pro bakers, milk not only adds flavor but has an influence on elasticity during kneading (that is, during the formation of gluten). I usually use half water half semi-skim milk, and I find it a good balance between flavor and texture.
Regarding water, it’s better to use filtered water or spring water. If you use tap water, leave it a couple of hours inside a glass so that chlorine can evaporate.
5. Is it necessary to use eggs in the croissants dough?
Although some recipes add egg, croissant dough does NOT carry egg. Other similar doughs, such as the Danish pastry, do carry it. Egg would provide a rather “brioche” texture, but in the case of croissants we are looking for a drier and lighter texture.
6. Is it essential to add salt?
Yes, especially in fermented doughs. First of all because it strengthens the gluten and increases the absorption of water. And secondly because it slows down the activity of the yeast. In the case of croissants, we do not want the dough to ferment during the whole process; salt helps us to slown down fermentation.
7. What is malted barley flour for?
I use malted barley flour in many of my breads not only to enhance the flavor, but also to improve the crust. I love the touch it gives to croissants, but it is a very personal criterion and its use is completely optional. You can find it in specialized stores and in organic food shops.
8. What is the best butter for laminating?
Butter is the characteristic flavor of a good croissant. That is why it is very important to choose a good quality butter. Professionals often use special «dry» butter specific for puff pastry, which percentage of fat is 84% (2% more than standard butter) and whose melting point (i.e. the point at which the butter begins to melt) is higher (34 ºC while that of standard butter is 28ºC). These characteristics facilitate the work of professional bakers by providing them with a butter that is easier to work with, with a lower degree of humidity and that withstands the high temperatures of the bakeries.
However, they are not easy to get and are often reserved to professional bakers. While it is true that this type of butter is ideal for making croissants and that its flavor is incomparable, it is not worth buying it. I have tried several butters of different brands and I can assure you that you can get great results using a butter of good quality from the supermarket. I usually use organic French butter (from Président). You will have to try until you find the one you like the most.
Of course, forget about shortening or low-fat products.

How to make croissant dough
Although there are many croissant recipes available, there are few variations from one to the other. After all, croissants almost always have the same ingredients, only the proportions vary. At the beginning it is normal to follow strictly the available formulas. But there is no perfect formula, especially because each of us uses different ingredients in different places. Using the same formula we would obtain different results depending on the type of flour we have and depending on the place we live (it is not the same to make croissants in Madrid, where the climate is very dry, than in the North of Spain, very rainy and humid).
The success of a recipe depends not only on the ingredients and the steps to follow, but also on other factors more complex to control such as the ambient temperature, the degree of humidity, the temperature of the dough after kneading, the power of the oven, etc. That is why it’s important to investigate, to try different flours and butters and to modify the quantities according to our needs, but also to be very methodical in all the phases of the process, i.e. to control the temperature of the dough and the proofing times, to let the dough rest between the folds, etc. Only then we will achieve a final product according to our requirements.
The formula that I propose below is nothing exceptional: I have been testing and adapting different recipes of great pastry chefs (Thomas Marie, Pierrick Challamel, Philippe Conticini, Daniel Alvarez, among others) to find a formula adapted to my needs.

Ingredients
For the croissant initial dough (détrempe)
300 g strong flour (Lievitati from Molino Pasini) (100%)
80 g cold water (26.6%)
79 g cold semi-skimmed milk (26.4%)
45 g sugar (15%)
30 g unsalted butter (softened) (10%)
6 g salt (2%)
9 g fresh yeast (3%)
2 g malted barley (0.6%)
For laminating
171 g butter (31% of the total détrempe weight)
Organization
Day 1 (Saturday)
– 7:00 pm: make the détrempe and chill it in the freezer.
– 7.30 pm: prepare the butter block and keep it in the fridge overnight.
– 8.30 pm: remove the détrempe from the freezer and store it in the fridge overnight.
Day 2 (Sunday)
– 8.00 am: start laminating, first fold.
– 9.00 am: second fold
– 10.00 am: third fold
– 11.30 am: cut and shape the croissants and let them ferment
– 2.30-3.00 pm: bake the croissants
DAY 1 – SATURDAY
7.00 pm – Détrempe (initial dough)
Place all ingredients, except the butter, into the bowl of the stand mixer and knead about 4 minutes at minimum speed.
I insist on the fact that the liquids have to be very cold to prevent the dough from overheating and begin to ferment during kneading. The temperature of the dough at the end of the kneading phase should not exceed 22 degrees C.
On the other hand, you may have to adjust the hydration percentage depending on the water absorption capacity of your flour, taking into account that the more hydrated is the dough, the harder it’ll be to get an open crumb (however the dough will be easier to laminate). After 4 minutes, add the softened butter and continue kneading 3 or 4 minutes at the same speed.
We have to develop the gluten so that the dough supports the later phase of integration of the butter, but not 100%, since we will continue to develop gluten during laminating. A kneading between 8 and 10 minutes is usually enough, although everything will depend on the flour your use and on the power & type of your stand mixer. Strong flours require a soft and slow kneading to avoid giving too much tension to the dough. We do not want too much gluten development because we will struggle extending the dough during laminating. The final dough has to have a smooth texture and with some elasticity (but not too much), and does not have to stick to your hands or the work surface.
When the dough is ready, shape it as a disc with the palm of your hand so it can cool faster, wrap it well in plastic wrap and place it inside a freezer bag. Put the dough in the freezer so that it cools quickly, without it becoming frozen (between an hour and an hour and a half depending on the temperature of your freezer).

Some formulas state that it’s possible to completely freeze the détrempe for a later use. I do not recommend it since the yeast weakens and even dies depending on the freezing time. It is better to give it a cold snap and keep it in the refrigerator (in the coldest part) until the next day.
     Important note regarding the temperature of the détrempe
Don’t forget that we do not want the détrempe fo ferment before laminating. We want it to rest in the cold so that it relaxes and can be extended more easily. The experts say that to avoid the dough to start fermenting, the temperature has to be less than 6 ºC. However, the temperature of our refrigerators is usually much higher, although it indicates otherwise. Ideally, place a thermometer in the fridge to check the actual temperature and adjust it based on the thermometer value.
Our détrempe is ready and has to rest until the next day. You cannot make croissants being in a rush. The détrempe has to rest in cold for at least 12 hours (at a suitable temperature, I insist). I have tried to make croissants the same day but the results are much worse.
7.30 pm – Shaping butter
Before going to bed, you must give the butter the right shape and thickness to be able to laminate the next day. Before cooling the détrempe, weigh it in order to calculate the percentage of butter that you will need to laminate. In this case, my dough weighs 551 grams and I want to use 31% butter on the total weight: 551 x 31/100 = 171 g.

Just before going to bed, my advice is to leave the kitchen windows open: the colder the kitchen is, the better! Working in a cold environment (less than 18 ºC) is one of the keys to success for laminating. When it comes to handling butter it has to stay cold at all times (that’s why it’s almost impossible to make croissants in the summer: the butter melts and it’s impossible to laminate properly!). I also recommend you to put blocks of ice in the freezer so you can place them the next day on your work surface in order to keep it cold between the folds. The best material to laminate is marble, because it keeps cold, but steel or wood also works. Later I’ll talk about the temperature and texture that should have the dough to start laminating.
DAY 2 – SUNDAY
8.00 am – Laminating: enclosing butter in the détrempe and first fold
The détrempe has rested all night in the fridge and the butter is shaped. We can start laminating. As I have mentioned before, it is very important to work in a cold environment!


       What is the ideal texture of détrempe and butter befor laminating?
Some croissant recipes state that to laminate correctly the détrempe and the butter must be at the same temperature. Well, this not quite correct. We shouldn’t think in terms of temperature, but in terms of texture or plasticity. Now, for butter and détrempe to have the same texture, their temperature cannot be the same. Butter tends to heat faster than the dough, so the dough (which is the one that seals the butter) has to be colder. As a general rule, I work with a dough at 8 or 9 ºC and with a butter between 11 and 13 ºC. You should control the temperature at all times with an infrared thermometer, although it’s very important to feel it with your hands, especially the butter: it has to be cold, but malleable (i.e., you should be able to bend it without breaking it: this is plasticity). If the butter is too soft and hot, it will come out of the dough during laminating and will end up mixing to the dough instead of creating layers. If, on the other hand, the butter is too hard and cold, it will end up cracking and you won’t be able to create layers. If you see that the butter and/or the dough heat up too much, do not hesitate to interrupt the process and cool them down.

9.00 am – Second fold
     How many folds are needed for croissants?
As a general rule, croissants are given 1 double fold and 1 single fold, or 3 single folds. Although the more folds, less volume, I always do 3 simple folds because it is more practical: I find it easier to extend the dough with a simple fold. The double fold requires more strength and we may apply too much pressure and break the layers of dough/butter.

10.00 am – Third fold
Repeat the process indicated in the previous video, wrap the dough in plastic film and let it rest an hour or an hour and a half in the fridge.
11.30 – Cutting and shaping
We have given the last fold and the dough has rested in the refrigerator (the last rest before shaping is longer, minimum one hour). Now we must rolling it out to cut the croissants before shaping.

     Straight or half-moon croissants?
There is a debate among purists about whether the croissant should be straight or half-moon. According to experts, a butter croissant has a straight shape, while a half-moon croissant is made with shortening. However, in the past it was the other way around: shortening appeared almost a century after the croissant was invented, so originally the real butter croissant had a half-moon shape (hence its name). With modernization and global economy, it was more expensive to produce butter croissants, so the shortening croissants (which takes less space and is more profitable) invaded the market. I choose the straight shape because it is simpler: I only have to roll the dough on itself once cut into triangles. The half-moon shape requires more technique.
12.00 am – Proofing
Our croissants are shaped and need to proof. To do this, we must place them on a non-stick tray (or covered with baking paper), leaving enough space between each croissant.

      Is it possible to freeze shaped croissants in order to proof them at a later time?
It’s possible although as I’ve already told, freezing and yeast are not quite compatible. If you decide to freeze the croissants, you always have to do it after shaping and before proofing; just place them carefully inside a freezing bag tightly closed. Of course, you should not keep them long in the freezer, since yeast will end up dying. When you are ready to bake them, let them de-freeze before proofing.
Proofing is a key point that requires time so we cannot be in a hurry. When we work with fermented doughs, we usually have the bad habit of wanting to accelerate the fermentation process (i.e. by placing the dough near a heat source or in a preheated oven). For croissants, I do not recommend it for a simple reason: we have spent time and effort in laminating the dough so that our croissants come out the best we can and we do not want excess heat to melt the butter and spoil all our work. As a general rule, croissants must ferment at a temperature between 21 ºC and 24 ºC (and a humidity rate of approx. 75-80%). For this, it is very useful to have a thermometer at home that indicates the temperature and humidity. Therefore, it is preferable to leave the croissants ferment at room temperature in the warmest room of the house (which is usually the kitchen). Or directly inside the oven (off and without preheating). If it is too cold in your house, you can try to leave the oven light on (the temperature will rise a few degrees), but always watching that it does not exceed the maximum fermentation temperature.
Humidity is harder to control. In dry environments, as we are not professionals and we do not have fermentation chambers, the only thing left for us is to create a humid environment ourselves. The most effective option I have found is to place a bowl of hot water (at about 70 ºC, warmed up with a kettle) in the oven’s sole (as far as possible from the tray where the croissants are). The croissants are left to ferment with the oven door closed, placing the thermometer inside to control the temperature and humidity at all times. The water does not get to heat the environment excessively (since it cools quickly), but the humidity increases.
     How do we know that croissants are proofed and ready to bake?
As with bread, fermentation is one of the most difficult processes to control.
The finger test that we usually use for the bread dough (light pressure with the fingertip on the surface to check if the dough has fermented correctly) does not work for croissants. After fermentation, the croissant dough is very delicate and it is better not to touch it. The test will have to be visual.

The proofing time will depend on the above mentioned factors and you will have to control the croissants, which more or less have to double their initial volume (not more). However, the biggest the croissant is after shaping (that is, the more rolls you have given on it), the more time it will take to ferment. In my case, the croissants fermented 3 hours at about 24 ºC and an approximate humidity of 80%.
3.00 pm – Baking
Preheat the oven to 190 °C (convection) for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, introduce the tray of the proofed croissants in the fridge. Cooling the proofed croissants before baking them help us to coat them with egg wash more easily without crushing them. On the other hand, the contrast between cold and heat will help development in the oven.
After 15 minutes, take the tray out of the fridge and give the croissants a coat of egg wash (either only with egg or with a mixture of yolk & cream or milk). During this operation it is very important to wash ONLY the smooth parts and avoid washing the layers (otherwise the egg will seal the layers preventing them from expanding correctly).
Bake at 190 ºC between 17 and 20 minutes depending on the size of the croissants, taking care not to open the oven.

     Is it necessary to produce steam in the oven to bake the croissants?
It’s not. If your initial dough was rather dry, you may want to produce steam during the first 5 minutes of baking. But it’s general not necessary, especially if you have fermented the croissants in a humid environment as I mentioned earlier.
When the croissants are browned and ready, remove them from the oven and let them cool completely on top of a rack.

How to keep the croissants once baked?
Homemade croissants are best eaten when freshly baked! If you want to keep them fresh, place them in a wooden box covered with a clean cloth.
If the next day they have dried a little, a few seconds in the microwave will make them crispy again. You can also toast them, they are delicious!

 

Learn from your mistakes: problems that may arise during the process
The best way to get a good result is to practice.
When I enclose the butter in the dough and begin to laminate, the butter leaks:
– The butter is too soft (hot)
– The détrempe is too hot and does not chill the butter enough
– The pressure on the roller is too high
When extending the dough to make the folds, the dough shrinks and cannot be extended correctly:
– Excess kneading of the dough
– Lack of hydration of the dough
– Lack of rest of the dough between the folds
– The dough is too hot and has started to ferment
In the oven, the croissants develop well at the beginning but they end up losing volume:
– Initial temperature of the oven too high: the croissants grow too much at the beginning, which prevents a uniform development
– Excess of fermentation of the croissants
– Yeast in poor condition
In the oven, the butter melts and a puddle forms around the croissants:
– Incorrect laminating (probably due to a too soft and hot butter): instead of forming layers that retain moisture, butter has been integrated into the dough and melts in the oven
– Fermentation temperature too high, which has caused the butter to start melting
– Oven temperature too high

8,https://www.marthastewart.com/312981/croissants,"Make the dough: Stir yeast, water, and 1 teaspoon sugar in a bowl. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Butter a large bowl; set aside. Put bread flour, all-purpose flour, remaining 3 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons sugar, and the salt into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the dough hook; mix on low speed until combined. Add yeast mixture, milk, and butter; mix until dough just comes together.Knead dough: Scrape dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Using lightly floured hands, knead until smooth, about 3 minutes. Transfer to buttered bowl, turning to coat.Let dough rise: Cover dough with plastic wrap; transfer to the refrigerator. Let rise until doubled in bulk, about 2 hours (dough should not spring back when you press it with your finger).Make the butter package: About 45 minutes after the dough begins rising, put flour and butter into the clean bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium speeduntil well combined, 3 to 4 minutes. Scrape butter mixture out onto a piece of parchment paper; shape into a rectangle. Top with parchment, and roll out to an 8-by-10-inch rectangle. Transfer to a baking sheet, and refrigerate 30 minutes.Roll out dough: Turn out dough onto a lightly floured work surface; shape into a rectangle. Roll out to a 10 1/2-by-16-inch rectangle, about 1/2 inch thick, with short side facing you.Place butter package on dough: The butter package should be cool but pliable; your finger should leave an indentation but the butter should still hold its shape. If too soft, continue to refrigerate; if too firm, let stand at room temperature briefly. Place horizontally on bottom half of dough; remove parchment. Fold top half of dough over butter package, and pinch edges of dough to seal.Roll in butter: Turn dough so that a short side is facing you and the seam is on the right. Roll out to a 10-by-20-inch rectangle, about 1/2 inch thick (keep the corners as square as possible).Fold dough into thirds: Remove any excess flour with a pastry brush. Starting at the far end, fold rectangle in thirds as you would a business letter (this completes the first of 3 ""turns"").Mark dough: Mark the dough with your knuckle (later, this will help you remember how many turns have been completed). Wrap dough in plastic, and refrigerate 1 hour.Repeat process: Remove from refrigerator, and press the dough; it should be pliable but have some resistance. If too soft, return to refrigerator; if too firm, let stand at room temperature, 5 minutes. Repeat the preceding three steps to complete two more turns (make 2 marks for the second turn and 3 marks for the third turn); always start with a short side facing you and the seam on the right, rolling lengthwise before crosswise. After the second turn, wrap dough in plastic, and refrigerate 1 hour. After the third and final turn, wrap dough in plastic, and refrigerate 8 hours (or overnight).Roll out and chill dough: Turn out dough onto a lightly floured work surface, and roll out to a 30-by-16-inch rectangle. If dough becomes unmanageable, cut in half crosswise, and roll out two 15-by-16-inch rectangles (refrigerate 1 piece as you work with the other). Chill in freezer 15 minutes. Remove dough, and remeasure: It should match original dimensions; if not, roll out again. If dough becomes too warm or elastic, chill in freezer, 15 minutes.Cut dough: Cut dough into two 30-by-8-inch rectangles (or four 15-by-8-inch rectangles). Stack rectangles, lining up edges (if you have four smaller rectangles, make two stacks).Trim dough and cut into triangles: Using a pastry or pizza wheel and cutting at a 20-degree angle, trim a small wedge from one short side to create an angled side. Cut dough into triangles, each with a 4 1/2-inch base. You should have about 20 total.Cut slits: Cut a 1-inch slit in the middle of the base of each triangle. Separate the stacks, transferring half the triangles to a parchment-lined baking sheet; cover, and refrigerate.Begin shaping croissants: Working with one triangle at a time and keeping remaining triangles covered with a clean kitchen towel, hold the two corners of the base, and stretch to lengthen it slightly. Grasp inner corners formed by the slit in the base, and lift and stretch them toward the outer sides of the triangle; press to seal.Roll croissants: Using your fingertips, roll the base of the triangle up and away from you, stretching the dough slightly outward as you roll to elongate the point (when finished, the point should be tucked under the croissant).Finish shaping croissants: Bend the two ends toward you to form a crescent shape (the ends should almost touch). Transfer to parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing croissants 2 inches apart. Repeat with remaining triangles. Cover loosely with plastic wrap, and let stand in a warm place until croissants have doubled in bulk and are very soft, 1 1/2 hours to 2 1/4 hours, depending on the temperature of room.Brush with egg: Preheat oven to 400 degrees, with racks in upper and lower thirds. Brush tops of croissants with egg. Bake, rotating sheets halfway through, until croissants are puffed and golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool slightly on sheets on wire racks.

9,https://www.noellecarterfood.com/blog/2019/9/20/better-baking-temperature-croissants-recipe,"“Chilled.” “Room temperature.” “Melted.” These temperature descriptions are found in many recipe ingredient lists, particularly when it comes to baking. When the urge strikes, those of us who love to bake make our way to the kitchen to start cracking eggs, cubing butter and pouring milk. But when a recipe specifies a temperature, it's easy to wonder, “Does it really matter?” Unlike much savory cooking, baking frequently comes down to science, with each recipe serving as a delicious lesson in chemistry. And temperature matters. This simple measurement can dramatically affect everything from the fluidity of an ingredient, to the emulsification of a batter, to the way an ingredient dissolves or is incorporated into the larger creation.  These descriptions are more than extra words in a recipe, they are the critical steps in creating that perfect chewy cookie, flaky pie crust or soft tender cake. I'll explain the ins and outs, and how to handle the science of temperature. CHILL OUTLet's start with cold hard numbers, a.k.a. chilled ingredients. When a recipe calls for an ingredient to be chilled, 35 degrees Fahrenheit is the ideal temperature. When butter is cut into doughs such as pie crusts and laminated pastries (ex.: Danish and puff pastries), it needs to be extremely cold in order to create pockets of rich, flaky goodness. Among its components, butter is made of fat and water. When it’s incorporated properly into these doughs, the water evaporates to steam, creating lift, while the fat creates crisp layers. If butter is too warm, it will melt into the dough before it has a chance to act, ruining the layers and creating a soggy mess. Too cold, and the butter is too hard to properly, and evenly, mix in with the rest of the dough.PRO TIP: If your recipe calls for chilled butter, as with pie crusts, make sure not only your butter, but the other ingredients, and even equipment, are well-chilled. Refrigerating everything will help insure the ingredients remain cold as you work your magic.Likewise, properly chilled ingredients can make a night and day difference in recipes as simple as a mousse, or even a basic whipped cream. Removing heavy or whipping cream from the refrigerator right before adding it to a recipe allows the air pockets that develop as it is whipped to remain in place and expand, all due to the cold fat in the cream. Have you ever tried whipping warm heavy cream? You’ve probably found you get less volume in the whip. This is because the fat has softened, lessening the ability of the air pockets to form and set. Pro Tip: Chilling the bowl of the stand mixer, ensure the cream stays cold throughout the whipping process. NOT TOO HOT, NOT TOO COLD — JUST RIGHTScones, muffins, cakes, and cookies frequently use what many recipes call “the creaming method.” The creaming method is when sugar and fat are whipped together, aerating and expanding the butter.  As the sugar moves through the butter, the tiny crystals create tiny air pockets that actually help the baked goods rise while they’re in the oven. Frequently, when recipes use the creaming method, they call for “room temperature” or “softened” butter. The best temperature for creaming butter is between 65 to 67 degrees Fahrenheit. Properly softened butter should give slightly when pressed, but still hold its shape. When butter is too cold, the butter and sugar can’t properly incorporate, and the resulting cakes and cookies are often dense and spongy. Eggs and milk, and other ingredients, should also be at room temperature to prevent the temperature of creamed butter and sugar from chilling.  Speaking of eggs, room temperature eggs also play a large role in baked goods. If cold eggs are added to perfectly creamed sugar and butter, the batter will deflate; cold eggs chill the room temperature butter, making it stiff, and losing aeration. And when it comes to meringue, sugar and egg whites seem innocent enough right? Still, temperature is key. When egg whites are agitated (whipped) the proteins in the egg whites unravel and bond with the water in the whites, creating a foam. Room temperature proteins in the egg whites break down and whip up faster than cold egg whites. PRO TIP: Shorten the time it takes for ingredients to come to room temperature with a few simple hacks. To soften butter, invert a warmed measuring cup or baking dish over the butter until it’s properly softened (add hot water to the measuring cup or baking dish, or place them in the microwave, to heat them up.) And placing eggs in hot water (around 110 degrees Fahrenheit) for just a few minutes will have you whipping up a recipe in no time. “MELTED”Do you prefer chewy cookies and bars? (Of course you do.) Melted butter is key in creating perfectly chewy creations. Whether you melt your butter in a saucepan or microwave (zap it for 10 to 20 second intervals), it should be between 85 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit and slightly warm to the touch. If the butter is too hot, ou run the risk of scrambling the eggs or crystalizing the sugar in your batter. LET’S GET BAKINGCroissants can be an intimidating pastry to create for the home baker. But with your knowledge of temperature, and my quick puff pastry method — sometimes called “a ruff puff” — you can cut your time, and effort, in half compared to traditional puff pastry recipes.

Homemade 
      Croissants Recipe & Video





Printer Friendly Page











A French Croissant is instantly 
      recognizable with its crescent shape that is golden brown and so buttery 
      crisp and flaky. When you cut into one you'll find the 
      dough has formed a beautiful honeycomb design with a texture that's 
      wonderfully soft. Yes, you can make them at home. While it's a 
      little time consuming, because of all the rest times, it's 
      worth every minute. And once you master the basic dough, you can make 
      plain Croissants, Chocolate Croissants (pain au chocolat), Danish 
      Pastries, as well as a host of other sweet and savory pastries. And 
      Croissants that are a few days old can be used to make Almond Croissants 
      (croissants aux amandes).  




 I learned how to make Croissants 
      when I took a two day hands-on class at the San Francisco Baking 
      Institute (SFBI). Our wonderful instructor showed us all the ins and outs of 
      making a great Croissant and we were able to make batch after batch to learn the craft. The recipe I give you here is from the SFBI, although I 
      have modified it for the home baker. And if you're ever in the Bay Area I 
      highly recommend this baking school.A Croissant dough is a laminated 
      dough. It's similar to puff pastry only it contains yeast. That means you have two layers of 
      slightly sweet dough with a layer of butter in 
      between. As 
      you may be aware, once the butter is encased in the dough it is rolled and 
      folded into thirds, three times, with resting times in the refrigerator 
      between the second and third fold. This does take several hours and it's 
      important not to rush the process.Croissants 
      are not that difficult to make. It's really all about precision and temperature. You must roll the dough to the required length and width and the 
      temperature of the dough needs to stay cool. You will find that if the 
      dough isn't rolled thin enough your Croissant won't have that 
      beautiful honeycomb interior. Instead you may have just a big hole in the 
      center surrounded by a thick layer of dough (looks more like a dinner 
      roll than a Croissant). Also, when rolling and/or shaping the dough, if it 
      gets too warm the butter will melt into the dough which again will affect 
      the texture of the baked Croissant. So if, at any time, you find your 
      dough is getting too soft or overly sticky when rolling, then return it to 
      the fridge until it firms up. If you're working in a very warm kitchen, I find it helpful to rub an ice pak over the 
      counter to cool it off before you roll the dough.
A few notes on ingredients. The type of butter used will 
      affect both the flavor and texture of your Croissant. For the butter layer 
      it's best to use a high fat unsalted butter (butter with 83% butterfat content) 
      as it makes a flakier croissant with a more pronounced butter flavor. In the 
      States this type of butter is normally labelled ""European style"" 
      or ""cultured"". 
      While we used a low protein bread flour at the SFBI, it can be hard to 
      find so for this recipe I have used 
      all purpose flour to make the dough. There is also a little 
      
dry malt 
      (diastatic) powder which breaks down the starch and gives sugar for the 
      yeast to feed on. This is especially good for doughs, like this, that have a long 
      fermentation period. Malt powder also aids in browning and helps the Croissant have 
      a good rise. I have used 
      
SAF Gold instant yeast 
      in this recipe. This type of yeast is normally used by professionals as it gives a 
      good rise, especially when making sweet breads with long fermentation 
      periods. An added bonus is that since the grain particles are so small, you don't have to 
      proof it first. What's great too, is that you can store it in the freezer 
      and then just scoop out the amount you need. However, you 
      can substitute with 10 grams (2 1/2 teaspoons) active dry yeast but I would 
      activate the yeast in the water, with a 1/2 teaspoon of sugar, before 
      making the dough.

and milk. With a bench scraper or wooden spoon, gradually work the flour into the liquid, making sure 
that the dry ingredients are moistened. Then using your hands, work 
the dough for a minute or two to make sure all the dry ingredients are 
thoroughly moistened. At this point the dough will be a sticky mass. Cover the bowl loosely 
with plastic wrap and let it ferment for about one hour (helps to develop flavor 
and aroma) at room temperature (75 - 78 degrees F) (24 - 26 degrees C) . 
After an hour transfer the 
dough to a lightly floured surface and press or roll the dough into a 14 x 10 
inch (35 x 25 cm) rectangle. Transfer to a lightly floured baking sheet, sprinkle the top of 
the dough lightly with flour, cover with plastic wrap, and place in the 
refrigerator for at least six hours (or overnight).
About 15 minutes before you 
want to laminate the dough,  take a 
sheet of parchment paper and draw a 10 x 7 inch (25 x 18 cm) rectangle on the paper. Flip the 
paper over. Take your cold butter and cut it into six pieces. Place the cold 
butter within the drawn lines on your parchment paper and enclose it in the 
parchment. With your rolling pin pound the cold butter to soften it a little. 
Then fold the parchment paper to make a 10 x 7 inch rectangle (like an envelope) and roll the 
butter until it fits this size. Make sure the butter is of even thickness. At 
this point you want the butter to be cold but still pliable. It needs to be at 
the same temperature as the dough. If it's too soft then place in the 
refrigerator for about 15 minutes. 

Rolling out the dough 
(lamination): The temperature of the 
dough is important when rolling it out. It is best that your kitchen is cool. 
However, I have found you can cool your countertop by running an ice pack over 
the surface before rolling.
Remove the sheet of dough and 
your butter from the refrigerator. Peel off the parchment paper from the butter 
and place the butter onto the center of your dough. Wrap the edges of the dough over the 
butter so they meet in the center. Press lightly to seal the edges. (The edges 
of the dough and the butter should be even.)
First Turn: Transfer the 
dough to a lightly floured surface with the sealed edges running vertical. With 
your rolling pin gently tap the dough and then roll the dough vertically into a 
22 x 8 inch (55 x 20 cm) rectangle. Lift the dough frequently as you roll so the dough 
doesn't stick. Flour as necessary. Roll end to end, not side to side, making sure the dough is of 
even thickness. When it's at the correct length and width, fold the dough 
lengthwise into thirds, like you're folding a letter. Make sure the edges of the 
dough are straight and even. You now have your first turn.
Second Turn: Rotate the 
dough 90 degrees so the folded edge is on your left (like the binding of a 
book). Repeat the process of rolling your dough to 22 x 8 inches (55 x 20 cm) and fold the 
dough again into thirds. This is now your second turn. Place the dough on a 
lightly floured baking sheet, lightly flour the top of the dough, cover with plastic wrap, and place in the 
refrigerator to chill one hour.
Third Turn: Take the 
chilled dough and repeat the rolling and folding into thirds one more time. This 
is your third turn. Again, place your dough on a floured baking sheet, flour the 
top of the dough, cover, and 
refrigerate one hour.
Sheeting: On a lightly floured 
surface roll your dough into a 16 x 9 inch (40 x 23 cm) rectangle. Again, place 
on a lightly floured baking sheet, lightly flour the top, cover, and refrigerate 
30-60 minutes (at this point the dough can be stored overnight in the 
refrigerator.)
Shaping the Croissants: 
Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Make a triangular template from a 
piece of hard plastic or cardboard that measures  about 3 3/4 inches (9.5 cm) across 
the base and about 9 inches (23 cm) high. On a lightly floured surface roll your 
dough into a 24 x 9 inch (61 x 23 cm) rectangle. Make sure to lift the dough frequently so it 
doesn't stick and this also allows the dough to shrink back. Then trim the 
long edges of the dough with a sharp knife or pizza wheel. Use the template as a 
guide to cut the dough into 11 triangles. 
Working with one triangle at a 
time, hold the wide end of the 
triangle in one hand and using your other hand, gently run your hand down the 
length of the dough to lengthen it. Then place the triangle on your surface 
and cut a small slit in the center of the wide end of your dough. Starting at 
the wide end, roll the dough into a crescent shape. Do this gently as you don't 
want to compress the layers. Place on your baking sheet 
and repeat with the remaining triangles. 
In a small bowl whisk the egg 
with the egg yolks. Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the tops and sides of 
each croissant. Place each baking sheet in a large plastic bag and let proof for 
about 1 1/2 to 2 hours at room temperature (75 - 78 degrees F) (24 - 26 degrees C). You 
know the croissants are proofed when you gently shake your baking sheet, the 
croissants will wiggle. Also the croissants will be soft to the touch.
Preheat your oven to 400 
degrees (200 degrees C). Place your oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of 
your oven.
Brush the Croissants again with 
the egg wash. Place the two baking sheets of Croissants in the preheated oven 
and bake 10 minutes. Rotate your baking sheet top to bottom and front to back. 
Reduce your oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and bake for an 
additional 10 minutes or until golden brown and firm to the touch.
Remove from oven and place on a 
wire rack to cool. Croissants are best the day they're made.
Makes 
about 11 Croissants.

Using a rolling pin, pound the butter flat and roll out to a 10-by-12-inch rectangle. Refrigerate until ready to use. Remove the butter from the refrigerator and let stand at room temperature for about 10 minutes, until soft and pliable—the butter should yield gently when you press it with your finger and hold the indent, like a ripe avocado. On a lightly floured surface, using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out the dough to a 12-by-28-inch rectangle. If the dough springs back, cover it with a kitchen towel and let rest for 5 minutes before rolling. Arrange the butter in the center of the dough so the short sides are parallel. Fold over the 2 short sides of the dough so they meet in the center; pinch together to seal. Pinch the long sides of the dough together to completely seal in the butter.

Croissant


What is a Croissant?
A croissant is a laminated, yeast-leavened bakery product that contains dough/roll-in fat layers to create a flaky, crispy texture. Croissants belong to the Viennoiserie or pastry category of baked goods along with brioche, Danish and puff pastries. A croissant usually contains normal levels of salt, yeast and sugar.1
The texture and eating quality of croissants are created by lamination and expansion. The lamination process is the folding of dough to create alternating dough and fat layers while expansion is caused by the leavening action of yeast fermentation, and physical separation of the dough and fat layers during the oven spring stage of baking as the water trapped between them vaporizes to steam.1
Origin
As legend has it, the croissant was invented as a special roll in Vienna to celebrate the end of its invasion by Turkish troops from the Ottoman Empire in 1683. The enemy decided to attack at night to avoid being seen, but the Viennese bakers, who were working at the time, realized the city was under siege and alerted the authorities.
To immortalize this victory, a baker with the name of Peter Windletter was selected to create the Hörnchen (“small horn” in German), with the shape of a crescent to symbolize the Ottoman flag and emblem. By eating this roll the people in Vienna celebrated symbolically their victory over their feared enemy. Marie-Antoinette d’Autriche, originally from Vienna, officially introduced and promoted the popularity of the croissant in France, starting in the late 1700s.1,2
How are croissants made?
Similar to brioche, croissant production follows the straight dough system. A typical croissant formula includes:1,3




Ingredients

Bread flour (white)
100.0


Liquid milk (scalded and cooled) or water
58.0


Yeast (osmotolerant instant dry)
1.5


Sugar

Total
177.7


Butter or margarine for roll-in
25.0*




*The standard quantity of roll-in fat for croissant is 25% based on total dough weight.
Commercial production
Producing high-quality croissants requires the following steps:1,3

Ingredients scaling/metering
Mixing for 4–5 minutes at second speed setting to incorporate dry ingredients and obtain a smooth, not fully-developed gluten (full development takes place during rolling-in procedure). Dough temperature after mixing should be maintained in a narrow range 22–25°C (72–77°F).
First fermentation (45 minutes to 1 hour at room temperature)
Punching down of dough
Resting in refrigerator or retarder for 30 minutes at 4°C (40°F)
Dividing or cutting bulk dough to obtain rectangular pieces of desired weight
Sheeting of dough with a roller pin or dedicated equipment
Laminating (sheeting and folding). Rolling in the fat using the English method followed by 3-fold. This method  results in 3 layers of dough separated by 2 layers of roll-in fat. By doing this, the dough is folded to form 54 separate layers (three three-folds).
Retarding/resting the dough in a refrigerator to allow the dough to relax for 30 minutes between each fold or series of folds. Dusting flour can be applied to the container or pan.
Make-up. In wholesale bakeries, croissants are shaped from pieces of laminated dough that have been sheeted to desired thickness and cut into a triangular shape. The dough is rolled starting from the base and given 3–4 turns or curls.
Proofing for 90–120 minutes at 26°C (79°F), 75–80% RH. The proofing temperature should never exceed the melting point of the roll-in fat.
Egg washing
Baking for 10–20 minutes at 200°C (392°F). Shorter baking times are possible in high  temperature ovens.

Baking high quality croissants

Application
In laminated products, quality of the baked goods product depends heavily on the ability of water vapor to force apart the dough layers during baking. This creates a flakier product with superior eating quality, vital for consumers’ acceptability and market success. The objective of lamination is the creation of a large number of separate dough layers. The more individual layers created, the flakier the finished product will be.4
It is important to maintain a relatively low temperature in the bakery (10–20°C or 50–68°F) in order to keep the roll-in fat plastic below its melting point so its pliable and not absorbed by the dough. Care should also be exercised to prevent the fat from becoming too firm at cold temperatures as this could cause handling issues. The temperature inside the plant can be controlled with a properly installed HVAC system.
The key quality parameters when purchasing laminating fats is their melting point and temperature range of plasticity, i.e., essential for better workability of the dough at room temperature.

Let stand until foamy, about 5 to 10 minutes.To mix the dough by hand, In a large bowl, combine the remaining sugar, the salt, melted butter, milk, the yeast mixture and 1/2 cup of the flour, and mix with a wooden spoon until blended. Gradually add the remaining flour 1/2 cup at a time and mix just until the dough comes together in a sticky ball.To mix the dough by stand mixer, In the large bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the remaining sugar, the salt, melted butter, milk and the yeast mixture and mix on medium speed until combined. Gradually add the flour 1/2 cup at a time and mix just until the dough comes together in a stick ball.On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a rectangle about 1/2 inch thick. Transfer to a large baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Place in the fridge until chilled, about 40 minutes.While the dough is chilling make the butter package. I found it was easiest to place all four sticks of butter together in a gallon size ziplock bag. Then using a rolling pin, beat the butter on a work surface to flatten it. Continue to gently beat the butter with the rolling pin to shape the butter into a 6-by-8-inch rectangle. This part was really kind of hard, but just keep working it. Once the butter is in the shape of a rectangle place it back in the fridge to stiffen up again. Don't worry if your butter is not in a perfect rectangle. It's still going to work.Now it is time to laminate the dough, which just means fold the dough with the butter to create layers. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough into a 16-by-10-inch rectangle. With a short side facing you, place the butter in the middle of the dough. Fold the ends up like a letter. Fold over the upper half to cover the butter and press the edges together to seal. Then fold over the remaining lower half and press the edges together to seal. Turn dough again so the short side is facing you, and use the rolling pin to press down equally on the dough to help flatten it. Roll dough into a 15 x 10 inch rectangle. Then fold the dough like a letter again, with a short side facing you, fold the bottom third up, then fold the top third down. Use your hands to pull the dough into a rectangle shape. You should now have a roughly 11 x 6 inch rectangle. This completes the first turn. Wrap in plastic wrap and place in the fridge to chill for 45 minutes.Return the chilled dough to the lightly floured work surface with a folded side to your left and repeat the process to make 3 more turns, rolling, folding and chilling the dough each time, for a total of 4 turns. After the final turn, refrigerate the dough for at least 4 hours or overnight (I chilled mine overnight).To form the croissants, cut the dough in half and place one half in the fridge while working with the other half. Roll out one half of the pastry on a lightly floured work surface into a 9-by-18-inch rectangle. Using a pizza cutter or sharp knife cut the dough in half lengthwise, and then cut the dough into triangles. Cut a small vertical slit right into the middle of the straight end, and using both hands, roll croissant up pushing the sides out to either side. Place on a baking sheet about 2-3 inches apart, cover with a towel and set in a warm place to rise for 1-2 hours. The croissants will not double in size like other yeast doughs do. After one hour position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees F.Lightly brush the tops of the pastries with the egg mixture. Bake the pastries, 1 sheet at a time, until golden brown, 15-18 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool on the pan. Serve warm or at room temperature. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 day. Makes 25-32 croissants.To freeze the croissants before baking, complete the steps through step 8. Once all the croissants have been rolled place them on a baking sheet lined with wax or parchment paper. Cover the baking sheets and freeze for about 2 hours. Remove the pans and place the croissants in a freezer safe bag and seal. Immediately place back in the freezer and freeze for up to 6 months. To bake, allow the croissants to thaw overnight in the fridge and then bake as directed.Optional fillings for the croissants:&nbsp;1-2 teaspoons of pure pumpkin&nbsp;1 -2 teaspoons peanut butter + 1 square of chocolate&nbsp;1 teaspoon cinnamon sugar&nbsp;1-2 teaspoons NutellaRoll each triangle up as directed. Brush each top with egg wash and for the pumpkin and cinnamon sugar croissants, sprinkle with more cinnamon sugar. Bake as directed.",croissant

Mix on low speed until the dough starts to come together, about 2 minutes. Increase the speed to medium and continue to mix until completely combined and gathered into a ball that is no longer sticky to the touch, about 5 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured baking sheet, dust the top with flour and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight.The following day, put the remaining cold butter pieces (2 1/2 sticks) in the middle of a piece of parchment and dust with a generous pinch of flour. Top with another piece of parchment. With a rolling pin, pound the butter to form a 7-inch square, using a bench scraper or ruler to help even out the sides. Refrigerate while you roll out the dough.To roll and fold the dough: Unwrap the dough and lay it on a lightly floured work surface. Roll into a 12-inch square, dusting with flour as needed. Peel the parchment off the butter square and position the butter in the middle of the dough. Fold the top flap of dough over the butter towards you, stretching it slightly so that it reaches just past the center of the butter. Repeat with the opposite flap so they overlap by a couple inches. Turn the dough so that one of the open ends is closest to you.Using the rolling pin, gently pound the dough so the butter is spread out evenly in the middle of the dough. Then, roll the dough to an 8-by-24-inch rectangle. Pick up one short end of the dough and fold it back over the dough, leaving one-third of the other end of dough exposed. Then fold the exposed dough over the folded side (like folding a letter). Put the dough back on the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap and chill so the dough relaxes and the butter firms slightly, 20 to 30 minutes. Lay the dough on a lightly floured work surface folded-side down. Roll in the direction of the 2 open ends, until the dough is about an 8-by-24-inch rectangle. Fold the dough in thirds again like a letter, put back on the baking sheet, cover and chill for another 20 minutes. Give the dough a third rolling, then fold one side to the middle of the dough and fold the other side to meet it in the middle. Fold the dough in half so it resembles a book. Put the dough on the baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap, tucking the plastic under all sides. Refrigerate for 2 hours and up to overnight.To divide the dough: Unwrap the dough and lightly flour the top and bottom. Roll the dough into a 10-by-35-inch rectangle. Lay the dough in front of you so the long sides are horizontal. Position a ruler lengthwise along the bottom side of the dough (the side closest to you) and mark with a paring knife every 5 inches along the length of the dough. Move the ruler to the top side of the dough (the side farthest from you) and make a mark on the dough at 2 1/2 inches. Move the ruler to the 2 1/2-inch mark, then make marks every 5 inches along the length of the dough from that point. Using a pizza cutter or long sharp knife, make a diagonal cut from the bottom left corner to the first mark on the top edge (at 2 1/2 inches), then cut diagonally down from that mark to the first 5-inch mark on the bottom edge of the dough, to make a triangle. Continue cutting diagonally from bottom mark to top mark and back again to create 15 triangles total (2 will be from the ends and a little smaller but still useable).Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Lay one triangle on the work surface with the short side closest to you. Gently pull to extend the tip at the top. With one hand on each side of the short end of the triangle, start to roll the dough away from you towards the pointed end. Press down on the dough with enough force to make the layers stick together. Arrange the croissant on one of the lined baking sheets with the tip of the dough on the bottom. Repeat with the remaining dough triangles.Whisk the egg with a splash of water in a small bowl until combined. Lightly brush some of the egg wash on each croissant. (Refrigerate the remaining egg wash for later.) Put the croissants in a warm spot to proof, until puffy looking and about 1 1/2 times larger, about 2 hours.Position oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees F. Brush the croissants again with the egg wash. Bake for 10 minutes, then rotate the sheets from front to back and top to bottom. Continue baking until dark golden, another 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheets on wire racks.",croissant

Make the preferment: In a medium bowl, whisk together 1 cup of the flour with the water and a pinch of the yeast until smooth. Cover in plastic wrap and let sit somewhere warm for 5 hours. 2. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, combine the preferment and the remaining 2½ cups of flour, the remaining yeast, the milk, sugar, salt and softened butter. Mix until a dough comes together, then transfer to a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth, 2 minutes. On a parchment-lined sheet pan, shape the dough into a rectangle and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight. 3. The next day, laminate the dough: On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough into a 14-by-20-inch horizontal rectangle. 4. On a floured sheet of parchment paper, beat the 2½ sticks of unsalted butter with a rolling pin to flatten. Using flour as needed, roll the butter into a 9-by-13-inch rectangle. Peel off the parchment paper and place the butter insert on the right half of the dough. 5. Fold the dough over the butter and seal the edges. Fold the top third and bottom third of the dough in like a letter and place the folded dough, seal down, on a parchment-lined sheet pan. Chill for 30 minutes. 6. Roll the chilled dough into a 14-by-16-inch horizontal rectangle, then complete a trifold, folding the left and right ends in like a letter. Chill the dough for 30 minutes. Repeat this process 2 more times for a total of 4 trifolds, and then chill again for 30 minutes. 7. Roll the laminated dough into a 9-by-40-inch horizontal rectangle (this will take about 10 minutes). Using a sharp knife, cut 5-inch notches into the top edge of the rectangle. Begin to cut triangles, cutting to the centerpoint of each notch. You should end up with 14 triangles. 8. Working from the wide end of the triangle, roll the dough into a croissant shape, tucking the end of the dough underneath. Place the rolled croissants on 2 parchment-lined sheet pans, 2 inches apart. Lightly brush each one with some of the beaten egg, then place them somewhere warm to proof for 2 hours, until the croissants have risen and you can see the layers of butter. 9. Preheat the oven to 350º. After proofing, brush the croissants again with the remaining egg, then bake, rotating every 10 minutes, until golden brown and risen, 30 minutes.

Cover with plastic wrap and freeze butter and the croissant dough for 20 minutes.Remove dough from the freezer and roll on a very lightly floured surface with a very lightly floured rolling pin into a 15x7.9 inches (38x20 cm) rectangle, 0.3 inches (7-8mm) thick. Place butter slab on one half of the croissant dough that there is about 0.4 inches space around three edges and fold the other dough-half over the butter. Completely seal the butter inside the dough by pressing the edges together. Make sure that there are no air bubbles between the layers. Rotate 90°.Just use as much flour as needed that the dough doesn't stick. Firmly but carefully press the dough with the rolling pin starting on both sealed ends. Then stop pressing and begin rolling the dough. Be careful and don't work the dough over that the butter doesn't incorporate with the dough. Roll the croissant dough just in one direction into a&nbsp;15x7.9 inches (38x20 cm) rectangle, 0.3 inches (7-8mm) thick. Rotate the dough 180° while rolling to keep it even, if needed. Make sure that you lengthen the dough instead of widening it and keep the edges as straight as possible. Shape the corners with your hands to a square.Remove all excess flour from the dough before folding it, if there is any. Take one short side and fold one-third of the dough over itself that about 2/3 of the dough is covered by itself. Then take the other short side and flap it over itself that it touches the edge of the previously folded part. The croissant dough has now 1/3 of its original size. Then fold it in half. You should have a rectangle with 4 layers of dough. Be sure that you remove all excess flour between each layer. Cover with plastic foil tightly and freeze for 30 minutes.&nbsp;Roll the dough in the direction of the two open ends with the fold to your right until it is a&nbsp;15x7.9 inches (38x20 cm) rectangle, 0.3 inches (7-8mm) thick. Be careful, not to overwork the dough and take as little flour as possible. Keep the edges as straight as possible. Rotate 180° while rolling to stay even, if needed. Pick up one short end and fold one-third of the dough on itself. Pick up the other short end and fold on top that it covers itself (letter style). You should have a 3-layered dough.&nbsp;Cover with plastic foil tightly and freeze for 30 minutes.Turn the dough again by 90° from the previous position, and roll into a 26x10.6 inches (66x27cm) rectangle, 0.12-0.15 inches (3-4mm) thick. And again, take as little flour as possible, keep the edges as straight as possible, and don't overwork the dough.&nbsp;Shape the corners with your hands to a square.With a sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut off 0.4 inches all around the rectangle to reveal the multilayered puff pastry. The croissant dough should be 25.2x9.85 inches (64x25cm) in&nbsp;size. Transform it into a parallelogram by picking up 2 corners of the dough opposite the diagonal and stretch gently. Use a tape measure or yardstick and measure both long sides of the dough (should be still&nbsp;25.2 inches / 64cm) and divide each side through 7-8.&nbsp;This&nbsp;makes sure that your croissants are all the same size.&nbsp;Depending on your parallelogram and the precision of your cut, you get 14 or 16 croissants. Then cut triangles with the tape measure. The cut croissants should be between 3.15-3.55 inches (8-9cm) wide and 9.85 inches (25cm) long. Cover with plastic foil and freeze for 15 minutes.Line 3 baking sheets with parchment paper. Set aside. Remove croissants from the freezer and cut with a knife 0.2-inch (5mm) slits in the middle of the short sides. Place croissants with the notched side towards you. Roll the dough up and away from you, moving your hands outward from the center. Lightly press the tip to close the croissants. Place croissants on prepared baking sheets (a maximum of 6 croissants per baking sheet) with enough space between each croissant. They will triple in size.&nbsp;Place the dough tip underneath that they don't unroll during baking.Combine egg and egg yolk in a small bowl and lightly brush croissants. Your oven should have a temperature of 80-85°F (26-29°C). Maybe you need to open the door for 1-2 minutes&nbsp;if it is warmer than that.Pour boiling water in a heat-proof bowl. Arrange all baking sheets in the oven and the boiling water on the bottom of the oven.&nbsp;Close the door and let the croissants rise for 2.5 hours.&nbsp;This trick can simulate a professional oven. It lets the croissants rise high and prevents them from drying out.Remove croissants from the oven and preheat to 375°F (190°C). Carefully brush croissants a second time with eggs. Bake one sheet at the time for about 16-20 minutes until they have&nbsp;a brown and even color. Let cool on the baking sheets&nbsp;for 5 minutes&nbsp;then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Even if the croissants are best eaten fresh on the same day, you can store them in an airtight container at room temperature up to 3 days.

Un Panier de Croissants.. A Basket of Croissants
With Mother’s Day just around the corner Sydney and I have had numerous request to teach a class on Pâte à Croissants (Croissant dough). To be honest I was not ecstatic  at the thought of conducting a culinary class on croissants without having taught a beginner bread and pastry class. Pains sucré or sweet bread dough has caused calm sane people to revert to a two year old having a tantrum. However a good friend of Sydney’s wanted to learn the method and technique to prepare croissants for a Mother’s day brunch she was hosting; her mother had just finished a long painful battle with breast cancer and this is going to be their first Mother’s Day without chemotherapy. I could not in good conscience refuse.


You can almost smell the buttery goodness!
Sydney and I decided six students would have to be the limit, three students per instructor seemed appropriate. In theory the recipe has few ingredients yeast (fresh or active dry), flour, liquid, sugar and salt. As I mentioned prior jumping into creating flaky light buttery croissants without any previous knowledge of yeast breads seemed a recipe for disaster. Sydney and I began brainstorming a successful, flourishing, and enjoyable pains (bread) class. Since croissants can take a minimum of 12 hours to a maximum of 3 days,depending how the method used, we concluded it would be advantageous instead of only teaching croissants to teach a pâte feuilletée  (puff pastry), pâte à brioche (brioche), and pâte à croissant (croissant) class over a 5 day period.
Croissants are, in my opinion, across between pâte à brioche and pâte feuilletée. Both puff pastry and croissants need the détrempe and barrage at the same temperature, , rest in the refrigerator between rolls, and use the same method of rolling, folding, and turning. Brioche and croissants each use yeast to rise the dough, and need to be proofed more than once.


After we completed a schedule for the week, we were ready for our group of students, the only prerequisite I asked was each student needed to have an understanding of yeast breads. We prepared six  syllabuses, recipes for the puff pastry, brioche, and croissant, and each student received a mini food processor. When Monday arrived we were ready and motivated.
Since my intention is not to bore you with the details of the entire week from here on I will only be referring to the croissant portion. I must admit, for most part, the class went rather smoothly and all had a tremendous time. I will start with same line I said as we began the croissant portion, “please take a deep breath and release slowly.” If you are confident the dough will be submissive to you.
Prior to beginning anything prepare your mise en place

We used fresh compressed yeast (also called cake yeast), but active drive yeast works fine and I have given both versions.

Pâte à Croissant Dough 11:

244 grams/ 1-cup whole milk, warm about 35 degrees C/ 95 degrees F
110 grams/1/2-cup heavy cream, warm about 35 degrees F/ 95 degrees F
29.9 grams/ 1.3 ounces fresh yeast or 13 grams dry yeast/ 1 Tablespoon, plus ¼ -teaspoon
4 grams/ 1- teaspoon sugar
18 grams/1 Tablespoon salt
50 grams/ ¼-cups brown sugar, granulated white sugar may be subsituted
480 to 540 gram/ 4 -4½ -cups T-45 or all- purpose flour, reserve 60 grams/ 1/2 cup
340 grams butter, cold
25 grams/ 2-Tablespoons flour

Prepare your mise en place. In a small bowl whisk the flour and set aside covered.

Détrempe:
If using dry yeast: proof the yeast with the 110grams/ 1/2 cup warm cream, 4 grams/ 1-teaspoon sugar, and yeast. Adding the yeast to the warm cream and then the sugar allowing it to sit for about 7 minutes.
If using fresh yeast:
a. Dissolve 1 teaspoon sugar in 11o grams/ 1/2 cup cream, warmed  to 90°F – 95°F
b. Add crumbled Cake Yeast to sugar solution.
c. Stir yeast until completely dissolved.
d. Let mixture stand until yeast begins to foam vigorously (5 – 10 minutes).
e. Add mixture to remaining ingredients.
Either yeasts will look the same once foaming

In the bowl of a standing mixer add the yeast mixture, 480 grams of flour (reserving 60 grams/ 1/2-cup flour if needed), and the brown sugar whisk together, by hand, and then whisk in salt.
Using your dough hook on low speed add the warm milk until the dry ingredients are moistened. Raise the speed to medium (#4) and amalgamate for about 4 minutes. The dough should be silky, smooth, pulled away from the sides of the bowl, and will still cling to your fingers slightly.
Place the dough in a 4-quart bowl 0r dough bucket that has been lightly greased with butter or cooking spray.  Cover the bowl with the lid or  plastic wrap. Place the dough in  room temperature room (26 degrees C/80 degrees F ) for 30 minutes. If the room is colder preheat your oven to 150, turn it off, and the oven should  register at 26 degrees C/ 80 degrees F. Place the dough in the oven.
Using a greased rubber spatula, gently fold the dough.
Cover and place in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours to 8 hours.
The Beurrage:
Cube the butter into dice size pieces. I found the best way to combine the butter with the flour, is to place the cold cube butter and 25 grams of flour in the bowl of your standing mixer on low speed, with the paddle attachment, mix the butter and flour.  Once the mixture is amalgamated shape into a 28cm x 28cm 9×9-inche square (no thicker than 3/8 of inch). The butter should still be cool but workable- about 16 degrees C/ 60 degrees F.
Use it right away, the temperature must be at 16 C/ 60F to laminate properly.

Pâton:
**Laminate the dough
Take the dough from the refrigerator and roll out to 31 x 31 cm/ 12.5 x 12.5 –inches. Place the barrage (butter square) diagonally in the center of détrempe (dough) using the back of knife mark the dough at the corners of the butter, remover the butter at form flaps where the marks are. Roll the flaps a little. Now moisten the flaps slightly place the butter back into the center, diagonally. Wrap the butter by securely overlapping the flaps slightly. Wrap the pâton in plastic film and allow it to rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes, but no longer.
** The laminating method is one Rose Levy Beranbaum uses, I believe it works best.
Turning the Détrempe:
First Turn: 
Place the dough seems side up on a floured marble board. Keep your work surface lightly floured, gently roll the pâton into a long rectangle about 50 cm/20 inches long by 18 cm/ 7inches wide. Brush off the flour from the dough’s surface and give it a business letter fold (folding into thirds). Wrap the folded dough in plastic film, lay on a parchment paper lined ½ baking sheet, and allow it to rest in the refrigerator for 40 minutes. Mark the paper to keep track of the turns. I generally like to complete a total of 6 turns, but a minimum of 4 turns is fine. The dough will let you know!

Second turn through four or  sixth turns: (you may do up to six turns if the dough allows)
Start with a clean work surface that has been lightly floured. Position the dough so that the spine is faced to your left (like a book) and press down the edges of the dough with a rolling pin to keep them straight. (The upper part tends to roll out more than the bottom part). Roll and fold the détrempe the exact same way, but turn it over occasionally to keep the seams and edges even. Be sure to roll into all four corners of the détrempe, and use a pastry scraper to even the edges. A total of four turns should be completed; the third turn can have a double fold equaling four turns.

**The Portefeuille (wallet) Fold (only if you decide not to do four to six turns)
Start again with a 27cm/11 inch side running from your left side to your right. Roll the dough into a rectangle 40 t0 42cm to 25 to 27cm/ x 16 to 18-inch inches long by about 10 to 12-incheswide. Fold the left and right sides of the dough into the center, leaving a little space in the center, and then fold one side over the other as though you were closing a book. This is the famous double turn, also known as “le portefeuille (the wallet”).
The Portefeuille should be chilled for 2 hours.
** This is a method used by professionals.
Shaping the croissants:
To Shape the Croissants:
Begin with a cleaned flour workspace
Roll out the dough to 60 cm/24-inchs by 43cm/ 17-inches.

Brush off all the flour. Fold the dough lengthwise so it ‘s 15cm/6-inche/ by 56cm/22-inches. Using a croissant cutter cut across the long side. Brush off all the flour. Fold the dough over lengthwise.
Damp a cloth to keep your hands moisten while stretching the triangles.
Using a croissant cutter (or a pizza cutter) begin to cut, if using a pizza cutter cut a triangle) cut through both layer all the way to the other side. Open the folded triangles, so for every full cut there are two triangles formed.

Shape one triangle at a time, keeping the remaining triangles covered with plastic wrap.
Use the scrapes of dough to place in the top of triangle, keep them covered as well.

Forming the Croissant:
1.Cut the triangle.
2.Unfold the triangle carefully, cut along the fold to separate.
3.Gently stretch the triangle twice it’s original length about 23 cm/ 9-inches long.
4.Enclose a piece of scrape dough to pump up the middle.
5.With the point facing you roll the dough towards you, gently moving your hand down out to the side.
6.Curve the pointed ends of the rolled croissant to form the traditional shape.

To Shape the Croissants:
Begin with a cleaned flour workspace; roll the dough to 35.5 by 61 cm/14 by 24 inches.

Gently stretch each triangle about 9-inches long; first pull the base sideways- gently, but with a firm hand-then holding the base in your left hand, use your thumb and two fingers of your right hand to work down the length, elongating it. Place the triangle on your work surface with the narrow point facing you. Grab a ball scrape, shape into a football shape, and place the wide base of the triangle. Roll the base over one of the football of scrape dough to encase it about ½ inch. Continue rolling with the fingers of your left hand, keeping the triangle stretched with your right hand. Place the croissant on silpat lined ventilated sheet pan with the point underneath. Curve the sides so that they turn in on the side of the croissant facing you. Keep the croissant covered with plastic wrap while you shape the rest. Set about 6 to7 rolled croissants, evenly spaced, about 2 inches apart giving them room to grow.

Place the baking sheet of croissants in a warm place to rise, ideally about 26 degrees C/ 80 degrees F for about 2 hours or until the croissants have doubled in size and have achieved a light texture.

Egg Wash Glaze:
50 grams/1 whole egg
14 grams/ 1-tablespoon heavy cream, half and half, milk or water
Sugar for sprinkling, optional

Baking the Croissants:

Preheat the oven to 218 to 232 degrees C/ 425 degrees F, arrange the oven racks so one rack to the lower and upper positions. Prepare egg wash and very lightly with a pastry brush, brush the egg wash onto the croissants.

Open the oven, spritz the oven generously with spray bottle of water and quickly close the door. Open the oven door again, slide the croissant sheets into oven and re spritz. Turn down the oven temperature to 240 degrees C/ 400 degrees F. after about 10 minutes rotate the croissant sheets. Reduce the oven temperature to 191 degrees C/ 375 degrees F and continue to bake the croissants till deep golden brown, internal temperature should register at 99 degrees C/ 210 degrees F. (about 8 more minutes). They will finish baking while they cool.

Cooling the Croissant:
Once the croissants have achieved the color and correct internal temperature, remove from the oven and transfer to a cooling rack for about 20 to 30 minutes.

Since Mother’s Day is still 2 weeks away I cannot tell if Sydney’s friend created light flaky croissants for her brunch, but now she knows how!
Voila!

20,https://www.theredheadbaker.com/mini-butter-croissants/,"In a small bowl, gently stir together the water and the yeast. Set aside for 5 minutes.In the bowl of a stand mixer, stir together the flour, sugar, and salt. Fit the mixer with the dough hook attachment, and add the milk and the yeast mixture. Mix on medium-low speed just until the ingredients form a ball. Transfer the dough to a lightly-floured work surface. Knead for about 5 minutes, until the dough is smooth and a bit firm. Grease a large bowl with nonstick cooking spray, and place the ball of dough inside. Cover in plastic wrap and let rise for one hour at room temperature, then transfer to the refrigerator to rise for another 30 minutes. Lightly dust a work surface with flour. Roll the dough out to a rectangle roughly 9 by 15 inches (23 by 38 cm). Let the dough rest for 5 minutes.While the dough is resting, form the butter into a flat rectangle roughly 5 by 7 inches (8 by 12 cm). If your butter comes in sticks, cut each into 4 long strips, then place them on their sides, long sides touching. Place them between two sheets of wax paper and roll them together. If the butter becomes too warm, chill for several minutes before continuing.Facing one short end of the bread dough, place the rectangle of butter on the third of the dough closest to you. Bring the third of the dough furthest from you down into the middle, then bring the lower third with the butter and fold it up on top, as if you were folding a business letter (see image). Press the sides and seam to seal, then roll the dough lengthwise into a rectangle roughly 10 inches by 14 inches (25 by 35 cm). Fold it in thirds again. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and chill uncovered in the refrigerator for 10 minutes. Repeat the rolling and folding again, then chill the dough another ten minutes. Repeat the rolling and folding for a fourth time. Dust the dough with flour, then wrap in plastic wrap and place inside a gallon-size zip-top plastic bag, and refrigerate for 24 hours. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and its wrappings. Divide the dough in half. Rewrap one half and return it to the refrigerator. Roll the remaining half of the dough to a rectangle 12 inches by 15 inches (30 by 38 cm). Trim all sides so that the edges are straight. Using a sharp chef's knife or pizza cutter, cut the dough in half lengthwise, then cut each half in half, so you have four strips. Cut each strip into triangles that are 3 inches from tip to base and 5 inches across at the base. The triangles will alternate base and tip along the length of the dough. When all triangles are cut, roll them into crescents, starting with the base, and rolling toward the tip. Line two baking sheets with silicone baking mats. Arrange each croissant so that the point is on the bottom of each roll. Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water. Use a pastry brush to gently brush each croissant with the egg mixture. Set the baking sheets aside to let the croissants rise, uncovered, for 2 hours.Repeat with the second half of the dough in the refrigerator. Twenty minutes before baking, preheat your oven to 400 degrees F (220 degrees C). Bake the croissants for 10 to 15 minutes, until golden brown all over. Cool on a wire rack, and serve warm or at room temperature. ",croissant

22,https://www.baking-sense.com/2018/12/14/sourdough-croissants/,"Make sure your starter is active and bubbly before using. If not, refresh the starter and wait until it's fully active before mixing the dough. Place the starter, milk, yeast (if using) and 2 cups of the flour in the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment. Mix to form a thick batter. If working by hand mix with a wooden spoon. Cover the bowl and let it rest for 30 minutes.Switch to the dough hook. Add the sugar, salt and remaining flour. Mix until the dough gathers on the hook and clears the sides of the bowl. If working by hand stir in as much flour as you can with a wooden spoon, then finish kneading in the rest of the flour by hand.Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, turning once to coat the dough. Cover the bowl and set it aside at room temperature. After 30 minutes uncover the bowl, lift one side of the dough over into the middle of the dough. Repeat with the other three sides of the dough then flip the dough over. Cover the bowl and after 30 minutes repeat the procedure. Cover the bowl and after 60 minutes repeat the procedure. Cover the bowl and after 60 minutes repeat the procedure one last time. By now the dough should be lively, elastic and airy. If the dough is still sluggish give it another hour or two at room temperature.While the dough is fermenting, prepare the butter package. Draw an 8"" square in the center of a piece of parchment paper. Flip the paper over and line the 4 sticks of butter, side by side, in the middle of the square. Fold the parchment over the butter. Use a rolling pin or other heavy object (I use the flat side of a meat tenderizer) and rearrange the edges of the butter as needed. Fold the butter into the parchment and place in the refrigerator. 30 minutes before the dough is finished fermenting, remove the butter from the refrigerator. (If your kitchen is very warm, take the butter out 10 minutes ahead.) The butter should be firm and cool but a little flexible for layering into the dough.Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Do not knead out the air. Roll the dough to a 10"" square. Once you have a square, roll from each of the four sides to form a 3"" flap of the dough, leaving the center thicker than the flaps. You should end up with a square with four ""flaps"" coming out from the corners. Now it's time to layer in the butter.Unwrap the butter and place it in the middle of the square. Fold the flaps so they overlap and enclose the butter, pinching in the corners as necessary to glue the seams together. You should now have an 8"" square of dough with the butter enclosed. Use the rolling pin to gently press on the square to flatten it. Roll the dough to a 8"" x 24"" rectangle. Take your time to roll gently and evenly so the butter stays in one layer in the dough.Orient the dough so the long side of the rectangle is facing you. Brush off the excess flour. Brush the entire surface of the dough with cold water. Fold the right 1/3 of the dough towards the middle then fold the left 1/3 of dough over enclosing it like a letter. This is the first ""turn"".Orient the dough so the closed edge is on the top side and the open edge is facing you. Roll the dough again to an 8"" x 24"" rectangle. Brush off the excess flour. Brush the entire surface of the dough with cold water and again fold the dough like a letter. This is the second ""turn"". Set the dough on a sheet pan, cover with plastic and refrigerate at least 30 minutes.Remove the dough from the refrigerator and do a third turn exactly like the first 2. Wrap the dough and place it in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Roll the chilled dough to a 24” long x 16” wide rectangle. With the long side facing you, fold the top half of the dough over the bottom half to form a 24” long x 8” wide rectangle.Starting from the left, measure along the top edge of the dough and make a mark at 2”. Using a pizza cutter or sharp knife, make a diagonal cut from that mark to the bottom left edge of the dough. Save the piece that you cut off.Working from left to right, measure and mark 4” increments along the bottom edge of the dough. Working from left to right, measure and mark 4” increments along the top edge of the dough. You should have a pattern of one top mark between two bottom marks. Starting from the top left, make a diagonal cut to the next mark on the bottom edge, forming a triangle. Then cut from the bottom to the next top mark. Continue this pattern to cut 11 alternating triangles and one 1/2 triangle end piece. Save the 1/2 triangle piece you cut from the end of the dough.Unfold the triangles and cut each in half along the joint so you have a total 22 triangles. Unfold the 1/2 triangle pieces which you cut from either end. Pinch them together to form 2 more triangles.To form a croissant, hold a triangle from the wide base in one hand and gently stretch the width a little. Set the dough on the work surface with the narrow end pointing towards you. Roll the croissant towards the pointed end, holding on to the tip and gently tugging as you roll. Bend either end of the croissant towards the middle to form the crescent shape.Set the croissants on the prepared baking sheets, 3” apart. You should fit a dozen croissants per half sheet pan. Cover with plastic wrap and set in the refrigerator overnight. (see note)In the morning. Take the croissants out of the refrigerator. Allow them to proof at room temperature for 2-3 hours. The exact time needed for proofing will vary depending how active your starter was and the temperature of your kitchen. They should be at least 50% larger than they started and feel airy and puffy.

Refrigerate overnight.Make the Butter Block: Cut the butter lengthwise and arrange in a rough 6-inch square on a piece of parchment paper. Cover with an additional piece of parchment paper and use a rolling pin to pound the butter into an 8-inch square. Trim and straighten the edges, and put the trimmings on the top of the square. Pound lightly into a 7-inch square. Wrap in the parchment paper and place in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before using.Laminate the Dough: Roll the dough into a 10-inch square.

Place in a warm and humid spot until they have doubled in size, look puffy, and jiggle slightly if you carefully shake the baking sheet, about 2 hours.Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.Make the Egg Wash: In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and heavy cream.Once the oven is preheated, gently brush the croissants with the egg wash and let sit for 10 minutes.Bake the Croissants: Bake the croissants, one pan at a time, for 10 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees and bake for an additional 5 to 10 minutes, or until evenly deep golden brown.Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly before serving.",croissant

Well… sometimes a girl’s gotta do what a girl’s gotta do! This post has affiliate links that earn me a small commission if you make any purchases.Here’s how my life works: Sunday night I see a post on Facebook that Monday is National Croissant Day. I get excited and decide I want the best chocolate croissant available locally. Then I realize I don’t know where to get one…After asking for recommendations I realize that I can go to a somewhat obnoxiously expensive local bakery or I can try the Trader Joe’s frozen chocolate croissants that multiple friends assure me are amazingly good.The problem? This all happened at about 10pm Sunday. Trader Joe’s is closed, which means I can’t buy those frozen croissants until Monday morning, the day of the croissant “holiday” I need to celebrate. The instructions note that you have to proof them overnight before baking. Until I invent that way back machine, I don’t have those nine hours to wait.I tried googling to determine whether I could proof frozen chocolate croissants in my oven and – if so – how to proof frozen croissants. I came up with nothing. Fortunately, the four pack of Trader Joe’s frozen chocolate croissants are $4.49 at my local store. If I fail, it isn’t a huge waste – and I still have that expensive local bakery I can visit.I’ll admit, when I first looked at the frozen croissant, I had my doubts. This doesn’t resemble any croissant I’ve ever enjoyed.Wait, what’s proofing?When you bake with yeast, you need to proof your dough. That means it needs to rise prior to baking. Did you know that when you’re making these frozen croissants, you’re baking with yeast?It is not a step you can skip. If you put a frozen croissant into the oven and baked it, it would not rise as well or nicely as you want. You’d end up with a dense croissant, which is where proofing comes in. The amount of time it takes to proof dough varies based on the temperature of the dough and of your environment. In a cold house, it’ll take longer to proof than in the middle of summer.How to Proof Frozen Croissants in Your OvenThe instructions state to leave them out overnight to proof for nine hours. Well, I found you can speed that up. I’ve used my oven to proof dough before when baking bread that I wanted to finish faster.The challenge with croissants is that part of what makes croissants that light, flaky pastry is the layer after layer of butter in the dough. If I proof the frozen croissants, I risk melting that butter and losing flaky layers. Hello, balancing act!If your oven has a proofing setting, you’re golden. If your oven doesn’t have a proofing setting, it’s harder but still doable.With the proofing setting, turn your oven to proofing and set it to 90 degrees for 110 minutes. Place your croissants in the oven seam side down on a silpat covered baking sheet. Let it proof in the oven. Once your timer goes off just under 2 hours, remove the croissant(s) from the oven. You may notice a little bit of butter just starting to melt out, but that’s fine.If you have no proofing setting, preheat your oven to the lowest possible temperature. If you have space, I highly recommend a countertop oven for quick dinners and specialty applications like this! Once it reaches that temperature, turn off your oven and open the door for 30 seconds to a minute. Place your croissants in the oven and shut the door. Turn on the light inside your oven to give it a little extra heat. Start checking your croissants at the two hour mark to see if they’ve proofed properly. It may take up to three hours with this method, depending on how well insulated your oven is.Baking Your Frozen CroissantsRegardless of the method you used to proof frozen croissants, once they’ve risen, remove the baking sheet with your croissants from the oven. Place your tray on the counter and preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Return the croissant(s) to the oven and bake for 22 minutes, until golden brown.The hard part now is waiting for the croissant to cool enough to enjoy. Remember, you just heated that chocolate in a 350 degree oven. Let it cool 5 minutes so you don’t burn yourself!I may not have had fresh chocolate croissants first thing in the morning, but I didn’t have to wait anywhere near the nine hours (plus baking time!) prescribed in the instructions.If you wake up early, you can still enjoy these for breakfast. If you’re like me, enjoy your sleep because they make a great mid morning brunch. This was so good, I sacrificed and made another one just to test my theories and to write this post. You’re welcome.Now go enjoy that croissant because you know you can proof frozen croissants in your oven when you have a croissant emergency! Do you see all those gorgeous flaky layers?

This three-day version of my Classic French Croissant is the real deal! There are no shortcuts, but you will achieve the closest thing to real French Bakery Croissants (if not the same). The three days necessary for the process offers the proper time for the dough to develop, relax and build a rich complexity in taste and texture. A great weekend project, worth every effort and minute!
In comparison to my One-day or Two-day Classic French Croissants recipe, these will have the flakiest outside, most aerated crumb and have the most subtle yet complex buttery taste.



Sparing three days on a recipe can seem intimidating or even overwhelming, but this recipe only truly requires 2 to 2 hours ½ of your active time (depending on how comfortable you are with the technique). After completing this recipe once, you will be much more at ease with the process and can more naturally fit this recipe within your weekend schedule.




Before you start this recipe, make sure to read this post: Classic French Croissants 101 Guide, where I am covering all the essentials you need to know before making croissants for the first time (choice of ingredients, yeast, poolish, laminating, proofing, etc…). 
Summary of the timeline: 
(ie. Start Friday evening, and get freshly-baked croissants for Sunday morning)
Day 1: In the Evening (30 minutes active time, total) 
Make the poolish and dough. Refrigerate until Day 2. 
Day 2: Late Afternoon/ Evening (2 hours 30 minutes total, inc. 1 hour 30 minutes of chill time) 
Laminate the dough and shape the croissants. Refrigerate until Day 3.
Day 3: Morning (1 hour of proofing and 17 minutes of baking)
Proofing and baking of the croissants
Total: 4 hours, over 3 days



The equipment

Stand Mixer (optional – easier for kneading the dough; but this can be done by hand too)
Large working surface (ideally, cold marble top)
Rolling pin
Ruler or measuring tape (cm or inch)
Pizza cutter
Pastry Brush
Two baking sheets; parchment paper
Plastic film
 8×8-inch (20.3×20.3cm) or 9×9-inch (22.9×22.9cm) square pan
2 large air-tight containers (able to contain 6 croissants each).

Important note: Making Classic French Croissants is an intermediate to advanced level recipe. It took me several years to get a hang of “laminating” and “proofing”, having several failures along the way. I can’t promise your very first batch of croissants will be a success (mine definitely weren’t). But if you persevere, you will succeed!

Ingredients
For the poolish : 
½ cup + 2 tsp (140ml) water
1 cup (125g) French Type 55 flour or unbleached all-purpose flour
2 tbsp (17g) Instant yeast
For the dough: 
3 cups (375g) French Type 55 flour or unbleached all-purpose flour (+ extra for dusting)
2 ½ tsp (12g) salt
1/3 cup (65g) sugar
½ cup + 2 tsp (140ml) whole milk, cold
2 ¾ tbsp (40g) unsalted butter, at room temperature and cubbed
For laminating: 
1 cup (250g) unsalted butter, cold
1 egg + 1 tsp whole milk (egg wash)


Instructions
Make sure you read the Classic-French Croissants 101 Guide before you start this recipe. 
Step 1 – Make the poolish.
In a small sauce pan over low heat, bring the water to a lukewarm temperature and turn off the heat immediately (make sure it doesn’t get any warmer than lukewarm or it will kill the yeast). Stir in the flour and yeast and mix until well incorporated. The mixture should be thick and slightly difficult to mix.
Set aside for 30 minutes. The poolish will expand. It should triple or even quadruple in size, and become spongy with bubbles forming at the top. Photos below: Before and After. 



Step 2 – Make the dough.
Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, salt and sugar. 
Add the poolish (make sure you scrape the saucepan to get all the poolish into the dough) and the milk. Stir to combine.
Knead in the cubes of butter in three separate additions. Make sure the butter is well incorporated before you incorporate the next addition. 
Knead the dough for 5-6 minutes (in the bowl or you can transfer it to a working surface). The dough should be soft, smooth and slightly sticky. Do not over-knead. The dough shouldn’t be too firm nor elastic.
Cover a 8x8-inch (20.3cmx20.3cm) or 9x9-inch (22.9cmx22.9cm) square pan with plastic film and pat the dough into it. Cover with plastic film and refrigerate overnight. 

Step 3 – Prepare the butter
In the meantime, take the butter out of the fridge and cut it into about ½-inch (1.25cm) thick square slices (if using a block of butter – not sticks - this will give you 4 slices).
Lay a large piece of parchment paper on a working surface. Place the slices of butter flat on the paper to form a 5x5-inches (12.7cmx12.7cm) square.

Lay another piece of parchment paper on top. With a rolling pin, roll out the butter to a large 6.5x6.5-inch (16.5cmx16.5cm) square. Peel off the parchment paper, wrap the butter slab in plastic film and chill overnight as well. 

Step 4 – Laminate the dough
The next day (afternoon), take the dough out of the fridge. Take it out of the square pan, unwrap it and place it onto a large, lightly floured working surface (ideally, cold marble top / Do not flour it too much or the dough will absorb too much flour and become too stiff.)

Step 4.1 - Roll out the dough into a 12X12-inch (30.5cmx30.5cm) square – make sure it is even in thickness. Take the butter out of the fridge and place it in the middle of the square at a 45 degree angle. Fold a corner side of the dough over the butter, with the tip of the corner in the middle of the butter (corner side should be triangle-shaped, since the butter is 45 degree diagonal). Repeat with the other other corner sides of the dough, so they all overlap in the center and the butter is totally encased within the dough.
  
Step 4.2 - Lightly flour your rolling pin and carefully start to roll out the dough (with the butter inside) to a 8x24-inch (20.3cmx61cm) rectangle. Be very gentle when you roll the dough out: apply even pressure and work your way slowly (you don’t want to break the butter into pieces nor squeeze it to the sides – it has to stay enclosed within the dough). Keep it mind that 8-inches (20.3cm) isn’t very wide, so focus on lenghtening the dough to 24-inches (61cm), rolling back and forth, rather then widening it.
Once the dough has reached its intended rectangular size (8x24-inches/20.3cmx61cm rectangle), fold it like a letter lenghtwise (one side on top of the other). Wrap in plastic film and chill for 30 minutes.
 
After 30 minutes, take the dough out of the fridge and place it onto the working surface with the “open side” facing you (rotate 90 degrees; see photo right below). Repeat Step 4.2 (rolling to a 8x24-inch (20.3cmx61cm) rectangle and folding) and chill again for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, repeat Step 4.2 one last time, starting again with the open side facing you, and chill for 30 minutes. In total, you complete Step 4.2 three times.

Step 5 – Cutting the dough 
After 30 minutes, take the dough out of the fridge and place it onto the working surface with the “open side” facing you again and roll it out to a 8x43.3-inch (20.3cmx110cm) long rectangle. The dough will resist a bit (this is normal). When the dough is its intented size, make sure it isn’t stuck to the working surface by lifting it gently (it will shrink a bit naturally).

Working along the long side of the rectangle, make small cuts in the dough at 5 inch (12.5cm) intervals (you get 7 cuts in total). Working along the other long side of the rectangle, make small cuts at 5 inches (12.5cm) intervals, but starting at 2.5 inches (6.25cm) from the top of the rectangle, so these cuts don’t align with the ones on the other side – this will form the basis of triangles.
Use the pizza cutter and a ruler (or straight object) to make diagonal cuts (joining the top and bottom small cut marks), to create triangular cuts along the length of the dough. Discard of the two end pieces.

Step 6 – Shaping the croissants 
Using a sharp knife or your pizza cutter, mark a small ½ inch (2.5cm) cut in the center of the short side of each triangle.

Grab the shorter side, stretch it out slightly and roll it up toward the pointy end. 
Once all rolled up, press gently onto the pointy end to seal the croissant.
Take both ends of the rolled up croissants and slightly bend them to create a crescent shape. 
 
Step 7 – Proofing 
Carefully lift each croissant and arrange them in parchment lined airtight containers, leaving enough space between them to expand. Close with a lid, and refrigerate overnight.

The next morning, transfer the chilled croissants on parchment lined baking sheets, (6 croissants/sheet), leaving enough space between them to expand.
Whisk the egg with the milk and brush a first generous coat of egg wash onto the croissants.
Proof the croissants for 1 hour in a draft-free environment (make sure you read the steps to proofing here). 
Pre-heat your oven to 390°F (199 °C).
When the oven is pre-heated, brush a second coat of egg wash on the croissants.

Step 8 – Baking
Bake for 9 minutes. When the croissants start to become golden, turn the heat down to 370 F(188 °C) and bake for 7 minutes (1 or 2 minutes more/less depending on your oven).
Take the croissants out of the oven. Leave on the baking sheet for 2 minutes, and gently transfer them onto a cooling rack.

Continue beating until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 20 minutes. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.Meanwhile, pound the butter between 2 pieces of parchment paper into an 8-inch square. Make sure the butter is in an even layer. Place the butter into the refrigerator to firm up.Generously flour your work surface and turn the dough out. Roll the dough out into a 9x18 rectangle.Place the chilled square of butter on one half of the dough and fold the other half of the dough up over the butter so you end up with a square.Gently roll the dough with the butter inside into another rectangle. Fold the rectangle like a letter so you have 3 layers, starting with the narrow end. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. This is the first turn.Turn the dough so the long sides are on your left and right. Roll the dough into another rectangle about the same size then fold it the same way as the previous step.  Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. Repeat this process until you have made 4 turns.Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for 12-24 hours. The dough must be shaped and proofed within 24 hours.Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Cut the dough in half and roll each half into a 6x12 inch rectangle.Transfer each rectangle to its own prepared baking sheet. Trim the edges so they are even and refrigerate for 20 minutes. The dough should be firm but not brittle.Use a large knife to cut each rectangle into 6 triangles. Make a small cut at the center of the base on each triangle.Begin rolling up the croissants, curling the two side fo the triangle on each side of the cut away from each other. Continue to roll with both hands until the tip is underneath. Bend the 2 ends toward each other in the shape of a crescent.Arrange the croissants on the baking sheets, cover them with plastic wrap and set them in a warm place to rise until they've doubled in size, about 1 hour.Preheat the oven to 375°F. Beat the egg and egg yolk together until well broken up and brush the egg wash over the tops of each croissant.Bake for 35 minutes or until puffed and golden brown.

27,https://www.frenchtarte.com/news-blog//2014/10/les-croissants.html,"OK.  I think I make a pretty darn good croissant.  So this next recipe in Philippe Conticini's book, La Pâtisserie des Rêves, got me a bit excited to try another take on this quintessential French pastry staple.  Little did I know. . . . Over the years I've compared many croissant recipes and tested out a number of them.  I  considered ingredient proportions, mixing and kneading times, numbers of folds/turns, resting and rising times and came up with the recipe and process that has worked well for me.   So, you ask, why mess with (near) perfection?!  Because life is all about learning! As I read through Conticini's recipe for this laminated dough, I quickly developed a few concerns about some of his ingredient proportions and the kneading time he recommends.  There is a higher ratio of butter to flour in this recipe than that which I typically use, and I prefer my croissants not too heavy in the butter department. Strike 1.Pascal Pinaud taught me that the dough should be mixed ONLY until it comes together and NO MORE, so when I see a 5-minute kneading time, I start to worry.  Strike 2.The idea is to work the dough very little at the beginning, thus avoiding development of gluten at this stage.  That will come later as you put the dough through its folds and turns, essentially kneading it with your rolling pin.Conticini's recipe starts with making a poolisch which is a rough slurry of flour and liquid (water or milk) with yeast added.  I am certainly no expert on the use of a poolisch (also known as pre-ferment or starter), but my understanding is that it is usually a ratio of 1 flour to 1 liquid by weight to which a tiny amount of yeast  is added (0.1-0.2% of the weight of the flour).  Since 90 gm flour is called for here, by using this rule, the amount of yeast added would only be a miniscule 0.1 gm - a teensy, weensy amount!  This recipe calls for the equivalent of 6 gm instant yeast, or 60 times what would typically be used. Strike 3.     It’s better if the pre-ferment sits for 6-24 hours (at room temp or into fridge if holding for up to 24 hours) before adding it into the final dough.  This contributes to the flavor as well as the texture, crumb and structure of the end product.  In this recipe it sits for 1.5 hours. Strike 4. (Note:  I normally make a détrempe  (the croissant dough) with minimal mixing time, let it rest for 45 minutes at room temp and then into the fridge over night, tightly wrapped.  My steps are otherwise similar to Philippe's recipe -  beurrage, 3 single folds, final rolling, shaping, proofing and baking.)poolisch ingredients pictured above So here goes!For the poolisch simply mix the flour, milk and yeast, cover with plastic film and let sit at room temperature for 1.5 hours.  In the future I would use a rubber spatula rather than a whisk - a MUCH easier tool from which to scrape the sticky dough.poolisch pictured aboveYou can then mise en place the remaining pâte à croissant ingredients (the recipe calls for milk and water - I used all milk) and shape and refrigerate your butter block.  Above: flour, salt, sugar in the bowl; butter ready to be softened or melted; milk; yeastAbove: butter block 15 cm square Give the flour, sugar, salt and instant yeast a quick whisk in the mixing bowl, add in the milk and butter and top it off with the poolisch.  Mix with the dough hook on slow speed, then, once everything is incorporated, increase the speed to medium and knead for 5 minutes.Pretty rough.Above: still pretty rough after a 5 minute knead, but a bit more together Now cover with plastic film, let sit at room temp for 1.5 hours, then wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate for 2 hours.  You want the dough cool for the next steps.Above: after the 2 hours in the fridgeNow for the beurrage or the enveloping of the butter block.  Take your butter block out of the fridge a good 30 minutes before this step.  Tapping it with your rolling pin helps soften it a bit - you want it to be cool, yet malleable so it will spread evenly between your dough layers as you roll.On a lightly floured surface roll your dough out into an elongated diamond, large enough so you can place your butter block in the center and fold the corners of the dough over it, so as to fully encase it (sorry I forgot to take a picture of this!).  You should have a neat package of dough and butter.You should feel the butter out to the edges of your dough package.  Notice how rough the dough looks.I'll note here that this dough feels pretty stiff and isn't easy to roll. Strike 5.Now for the turns:  roll this package out to a length about 3 times its width and do a three fold (also called a single or business letter fold).Above: rolled out, ready for the first foldAbove: first three (or single) fold; dough turned to prepare for next foldThe photo shows the ""spine of the book"" on your left.  That's how you want your dough positioned for the next roll/fold/turn.  Wrap and chill for 30-60 minutes then do the same thing 2 more times, resting and chilling the dough between each turn for a total of 3 turns.Plan for a final one hour rest in the fridge before rolling the dough out for cutting and shaping.So here is where I really knew that this would be a fiasco.  As I continued to roll the dough for the turns, it remained stiff and difficult to roll. The dough started breaking down and butter showing through - NOT a good sign. Strike 6.I did struggle through to the final shaping, although my doubts were rising exponentially.Can you appreciate the butter showing through the dough in the photo above?Fortunately I had made some of my own croissant dough a couple of days before this, so I'll show you the final steps with that dough, as well as some comparison shots.When rolling the dough out for final cutting and shaping, give it a rest every now and then.  You want it to be nice and relaxed so it won't shrink up when you cut it.Above: almost there - resting before achieving the 9"" depthWhen cutting 12 croissants, I roll my dough out to about 24"" across and about 9"" deep.  I cut approximately 4"" sections of dough, each of which is cut into 2 triangles.Above: marking my (almost) 4 inch sectionsAbove: triangles cut, ready to be shapedI cut a slit in each base, pick up a triangle, give it a gentle stretch, then place it down and roll it up snugly, tugging gently at the tip as I roll.  The tip goes DOWN on the baking sheet.Here's a comparison:Philippe's recipe above - a shiny, shaggy, buttery sort of messMy dough above: smooth and looking goodif you’re not baking your croissants right away, cover them with plastic wrap and hold in the fridge until morning or pop them in the freezer uncovered and once frozen, wrap them tightly for up to a month until ready to thaw, proof and bake.If ready to proceed with baking,  brush on some egg wash and give them a decent 1.5-2 hour proof, ideally at a temperature from 70-78ºF. If you proof too warm, the butter will start melting out - not a pretty picture.The next two photos show after the proof.Philippe's above - layers more prominent, but it looks heavy and greasyMine above - layers more prominent and it looks light and shinyHeat your oven to 425ºF, give them a second egg wash and bake about 12-15 minutes.REMEMBER: watch what’s going on in your oven.  Every oven is different (I'll say it again and again)!!  I rotate and change positions of my sheet pans about half way through, and I gradually lower my oven temp throughout the baking time, depending on how my croissants are browning.  I want the surface to be nicely browned and the laminated edges to be tan not pale, or I risk a croissant that's doughy inside.Above: heavy, bready center, some exterior fragility and flakiness, but feels heavy in the handThe French Tarte above: not bad - note the little browned shards as I cut.  (Check out my next post for a tasting of some Providence croissant offerings.) Above: nice airy lamination, exterior fragility, and has a certain lightness in the handIt's hard to explain the feel of a good croissant, but once you've experienced it, you just know.So if you want to make croissants, choose a recipe other than this one in Philippe Conticini's book and practice, practice, practice!

They say that French is the language of love.
There are many reasons that I love anything French; lavender, wine, crepes, and the bread, oh just  to name a few! The ultimate French delicacy is the croissant; flaky buttery layers, light airy and crisp!
I can never resist ‘the croissant’!  it goes perfectly with everything and at any time of day.  There’s the ‘pain au chocolate’ and the ‘pains aux raisin’ and my all time favourite the ‘almond croissant’. It’s perfect stuffed into sandwiches or sweetened with jams, I can never have enough!
So this Valentines I decided to make one of the most challenging pastries a baker can conquer, and it is by far the most delicious pastry there is!  It is definitely a labour of love.  
I’ve talked before about my love for butter and how Europe sweeps my taste buds away. They have a higher butter fat content then we do here in the west, resulting in rich flavours! They spend so much time mastering their craft perfecting sweets and savouries and only use the best quality ingredients. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, your ingredients are the upmost importance! Don’t cheap out especially on butter! We are lucky that here in Canada, Stirling Creamery has some of the top quality butters around and even a butter with higher butter fat; Churn 84. This lovely butter is perfect for making your croissants to create those beautiful layers of buttery flaky dough!!
It’s the simple things in life that’s important and Valentines Day is a reminder to cherish and enjoy those; like a warm fresh baked croissant and a hot cup of tea served in bed with your favourite person, or a good conversation with your best friends and your favourite sweets.
“Mangez bien, riez souvent, aimez beaucoup”
“Eat well, laugh often, love abundantly.”
Happy Love Day

Author: Alie Romano Recipe type: Breakfast Cuisine: Baking Serves: 18   Ingredients  500g unbleached all purpose flour (extra for dusting) 140g warm water 55g sugar 11g instant yeast 140g whole milk 40g Stirling Churn 84 Unsalted butter (room temperature/soft) 12g salt Other Ingredients 280g cold Stirling Churn 84 Unsalted butter 1 egg + 1 tsp water to make egg wash Good quality Dark Chocolate (if making chocolate croissants)     Instructions  Day 1 Making your Dough In a small bowl add warm water and about 1 tablespoon of the 55g sugar, set the rest of the sugar aside. Dissolve the sugar in the warm water then mix in the yeast. Let sit until it bubbles and is foamy; about 10 minutes. Meanwhile in a large mixing bowl add flour, sugar, and butter. Once the yeast is ready add it to the dry ingredients, along with the milk. Mix dough on low with the dough hook attachment. Then add salt. Mix for about 3-4 minutes (note: if the dough seems too dry and is not coming together add teaspoon size of water) Shape dough into a disc. Place on a plate and cover with plastic wrap. Leave dough in the fridge overnight  Day 2 Laminating the Dough (butter block) Cut the cold butter lengthwise into around ½inch size slabs and arrange the pieces of butter on a waxed paper to form a square about 6"" x 6"" Cover the butter with another sheet of waxed paper. Using your rolling pin pound butter into a block of about 7.5"" x 7.5"". Trim the edges and put the extra butter on top of the square and pound lightly until you have a block of 6.5"" x 6.5"" Wrap and refrigerate until needed.  Take the dough out of the fridge and with the rolling pin roll the disc into a 10"" x 10"" square, trying as best as possible to keep the dough an even thickness and as square as possible. Get the butter block from the fridge and place it on a 45 degree angle to the dough. Fold all the edges over the butter fully enclosing the butter and seal the edges.  Now roll out the dough to a 8"" x 23"" rectangle. Start rolling from the centre and roll dough outwards, don’t go side to side. If you need to you can rotate the dough 180 degrees to keep even rolling. Fold dough letter style (folding one third of the dough on top of itself then the other third). Cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30minutes. Do this a total of three times; rolling into 8"" x 23"", folding into a letter, refrigerate for 30 minutes. Each time rotate the dough 90 degrees before you roll (keeping the open end of the folded dough towards you). After the third turn put the dough in the fridge over night until day 3)  Day 3 Take the dough out of the fridge and gently roll the dough into a long and narrow strip of 8"" x 43"". (if the dough is resisting, you can fold it back up and put it in the fridge to rest for 10-20 minutes. This is very important, if the dough won’t stretch anymore, fold it up and let it rest!!!) Once you’ve reached the dough length of 43"", trim and make clean straight edges. This is where I cut my dough in half and used half the dough for chocolate croissants and the other half plain croissants. You can do one or the other if you like, but I wanted both :). Cut dough in half and place one half to the side and cover with a clean tea towel. Using a measuring tape and a pizza cutter, measure out triangles. Lay the tape measure lengthwise along the top of the dough. With a knife, mark the top of the dough at 5-inch intervals along the length (there will be 7 marks in all if you are making all plain croissants). Position the tape measure along the bottom of the dough. Make a mark 2-½ inches in from the end of the dough. Make marks at 5-inch intervals from this point all along the bottom of the dough. You’ll have 8 marks that fall halfway between the marks at the top. Make diagonal cuts by positioning a ruler at the top corner and the first bottom mark. With a knife or pizza wheel, cut the dough along this line. Move the ruler to the next set of marks and cut. Repeat. You’ll have made 8 cuts. Now change the angle of the yardstick to connect the other top corner and bottom mark and cut the dough along this line to make triangles. Repeat along the entire length of dough. You’ll end up with 15 triangles and a small scrap of dough at each end  Now very gently elongate each triangle to about 10 inches. This is often done by hand. Now cut a notch in the middle of the short end of the triangle, roll the two wings by moving your hands outwards from the center, creating the desired shape with a thinner, longer point. Try and roll the dough very tightly at the beginning and put enough pressure on the dough to make the layers stick together (but not so much as to damage the layers)  Proofing and Baking Arrange the croissants on a lined baking sheet, leaving enough space between them. Combine the egg and water to make an egg wash and whisk until blended. Lightly coat the croissants  Cover with plastic and let rest in a warm place free of drafts. You’ll know they’re ready if you can see the layers of dough when the croissants are viewed from the side, and if you shake the sheet, the croissants will wiggle, approx. 1-2 hours.  Preheat oven to 400˚F. Add another thin layer of egg wash to the croissants. Bake for 15-20 minutes, keeping an eye on them. If they are browning too quickly lower the oven temperature by 10˚F. Let cool on baking sheets on cooling racks.     Notes The croissants are best served sightly warm. You can reheat them as well in a 350°F oven for about 10 minutes. They can also be wrapped in plastic and frozen for a month or more. Frozen croissants can be thawed overnight prior to reheating or taken from the freezer directly to the oven, in which case they will need a few minutes more to reheat.VariationsChocolate Croissants: Chop some good-quality dark chocolate and distribute it along the length of the dough cut into rectangles approx. 6"" x 4"" —use about ½ oz. or 1-½ Tbs. for each one. Roll it up and pinch the ends closed. Proof and bake the same.

29,https://www.tasteatlas.com/croissant/recipe,"First, prepare the puff pastry. Take a small bowl and dilute the yeast with some milk. Dissolve the sugar and salt with the remaining milk in another bowl.Place the flour in the third, large bowl and pour in the milk, sugar and salt mixture followed by diluted yeast. Knead the dough by hand until its texture is even and lump-free. Add some water if the dough seems too firm.Now, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave the dough to rise in a warm place until it doubles in volume, for about 2 hours.Next, transfer the dough to a floured working surface and press it with your fist. This will release the carbon dioxide produced during fermentation, and the dough will return to its initial volume.Using a knife, make a cross-shaped cut in the center of the dough. Spread each quarter like a flower petal and roll with a rolling pin until it is 2 mm thick, but make sure to leave a small thicker bulge in the center.Take softened butter and place it in the center. Now, fold each rolled quarter over the butter, so the dough takes a square form.The next stage is called “turning”. Gently roll the dough with a rolling pin into a rectangle three times as long as it is wide. The edges should be as straight as possible. Now, fold the dough in three to form a rectangular envelope to give it the first turn.Rotate the dough for 90 degrees, roll it out again into a 3x1 rectangle and fold in three as done previously: this was the second turn.Now, cover the dough with plastic wrap and place in a refrigerator for 1 hour.Do two more turns as described above, and put the dough back in the refrigerator for another hour.Now, roll out the dough so it is 6 mm thick. Cut into isosceles triangles: the base should be 14 cm long, and the sides should measure 16 cm. Now, roll each triangle starting from the base to the top.Cover the baking pan with baking paper and place the croissants on top. Make sure you leave enough space in between since the croissants will rise. Whisk the egg yolk with some water and brush this mixture over the croissants. Let them sit for 1 hour until they double in volume. In the meantime, preheat the oven to 180˚C.Brush the top of the croissants once again with the egg yolks and bake for 20 minutes.",croissant
30,https://www.paulhollywood.com/post/croissants,"Croissants are ubiquitous these days and they can be very disappointing. But, made well, there is nothing better than a warm croissant. Just add coffee and a newspaper for the perfect breakfast. Making the dough is a long process, but the technique itself is relatively easy. The crucial thing is neatness when adding the rolled out butter. If the butter does not fit neatly right to the edge of the dough, you will end up with parts of the croissant with no butter. It’s also important to keep everything cool as you work, including your hands. Makes: 12
Prep: 16-17 hours, including overnight chilling
Bake: 15-20 minutesIngredients500g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting10g salt, plus a pinch for the eggwash80g caster sugar10g instant yeast300ml cool water300g chilled unsalted butter, preferably a good-quality Normandy butter1 medium egg to glazeMethod1. Put the flour into a bowl of a mixer fitted with a dough hook. Add the salt and sugar to one side of the bowl and the yeast to the other. Add the water and mix on a slow speed for 2 minutes, then on a medium speed for 6 minutes. The dough should be fairly stiff.2. Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and shape it into a ball. Dust with flour, put into a clean plastic bag and chill in the fridge for an hour.3. On a lightly floured surface, roll out your dough to a rectangle, about 60 x 20cm; it should be about 1cm thick. Flatten the butter to a rectangle, about 40 x 19cm, by bashing it with a rolling pin. Put the butter on the dough so that it covers the bottom two-thirds of the dough. Make sure that it is positioned neatly and comes almost to the edges.4. Fold the exposed dough at the top down over one-third of the butter. Now gently cut off the exposed bit of butter, without going through the dough, and put it on the top of the dough you have just folded down. Fold the bottom half of the dough up. You will now have a sandwich of two layers of butter and three of dough. Pinch the edges lightly to seal in the butter. Put the dough back in the plastic bag and chill in the fridge for an hour to harden the butter.5. Take the dough out of the bag and put it on the lightly floured work surface with a short end towards you. Roll into a rectangle, about 60 x 20cm, as before. This time fold up one-third of the dough and then fold the top third down on top to make a neat square to make a neat square. This is called a single turn. Put the dough back into the plastic bag and chill for another hour. Repeat this stage twice more, putting the dough back into the fridge for an hour between turns.6. Your dough now needs to be left in the fridge for 8 hours, or overnight, to rest and rise slightly.7. When you are ready to shape the croissants, line 2 or 3 baking trays with baking parchment or silicone paper.8. Put the dough on a lightly floured surface and roll out to a rectangle, a little more than 42cm long and 30cm wide; it should be about 7mm thick. Trim the edges to neaten them.9. Cut the rectangle lengthways into 2 strips, then cut triangles along the length of each strip; these should be 12cm wide at the base and about 15cm high (from the middle of the base to the tip). Once you have cut the first triangle, you can use it as a template for the rest. You should get 6 triangles from each strip.10. Before rolling, hold down the wide base of the triangle and gently tug the opposite thin end to cause a slight tension in the dough. Now starting at the thick end of the triangle, roll up into a croissant. You will have 12 medium-sized croissants. For a traditional crescent shape, turn the ends in towards each other slightly.11. Put the croissants on the prepared baking trays, leaving space in between them to expand; allow 4 – 6 per tray. Put each tray inside a clean plastic bag and leave the croissants to rise at cool room temperature (18 – 24°C) until at least doubled in size. This should take about 2 hours.12. Heat your oven to 200°C.13. Lightly whisk the egg with a pinch of salt to make an egg wash. Brush the top and sides of the croissants with the eggwash. Bake for 15 – 20 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack. Eat warm.Taken from Paul Hollywood’s How to Bake, published by Bloomsbury Photograph © Peter Cassidy",croissant
31,https://epicureandculture.com/french-baking-make-croissants-puff-pastry/," By Margaret Paige Hoeschele, Epicure & Culture contributorFrench baking is no laughing matter, especially when it comes to how to make croissants with puff pastry.It’s true that la boulangerie (baking) et la pâtisserie (and pastry) are essential ingredients to the French cuisine.As every baker knows — and as anyone who’s watched “The Great British Baking Show” fully appreciates — ingredients must be meticulously measured and carefully combined to create the best finished product, and the French take this consideration to a whole new level.Creation and consumption of baked goods here are monitored strictly, and in some cases are regulated by law.Literally.Psst! Don’t forget to pin this post for later!The Laws Of Baking Like the FrenchThe French Décret Pain (Bread Law) of 1993 modifies regulations previously set in 1905 regarding the classification and production of bread.In this décret, each type of bread — pain maison (bread of the home), pain de tradition française (bread of French tradition), and pain au levain (yeast or sourdough bread) — is explicitly defined by the proportions of necessary ingredients, and the appropriate means of preparation.There are approximately 35,000 boulangeries-pâtisseries in France; about one per every 1,800 people.

Photo by Markusspiske/PixabayOnce home, I prepare myself a second cup of black coffee.And now, the work begins.Allez, c’est parti. (Here we go.)How To Make Puff Pastry: The French WayI begin with a recipe for chocolate croissants  — or pain au chocolat— from Buzzfeed Tasty.I figure, for comparison’s sake, it’s good to start with the most simplified and Americanized version of this classic recipe.This recipe uses yeast — a typical leavening agent most often used in bread baking — to fluff up the pastry, since typical puff pastry is too crunchy.The resulting breakfast pastry should be a piece of soft, buttery, flaky heaven.The second recipe I use does not contain yeast, so it’s more like a plain ol’ puff pastry, as opposed to the more bread-like breakfast pastry.Since this dough is supposed to rest overnight, I combine the ingredients, fold lots of butter into the dough — if I know one thing about the French it’s that the love good butter — and then leave it in the freezer overnight, to finish prepping with chocolate in the morning. The key to authentic French baking: lots and lots of #butter Click To TweetFrench pastry making. Photo by Stocksnap/Pixabay The second recipe is a combination of recipes from Julia Child’s cookbook, a book of recipes from Le Cordon Bleu — arguably one of the most well known and reputable schools of cooking in the world — and a how-to guide from Epicurious.I’ve used this recipe before, with some success, so I hope this one will be a real winner.The next morning, while sipping yet another cup of black coffee, I put my unshapely little pastries from recipe #1 into the oven.Then, I assemble several more pastries using recipe #2, which all turn out equally as misshapen.Still, I power through.I know it’s the American in me, but despite their appearance, I can’t help but take pride in my ugly little creations.The finished product. Photo by Alexas_Foto/Pixabay.However, as I sit in front of my oven watching the pastries puff out, I can tell they are becoming more unsightly by the second.Nonetheless, I figure they’ll taste alright.That’s what matters, right?There’s butter and there’s flour and that’s the important thing.Sadly, I was not reassured as I pulled my creations out of the oven.I took a bite of one to test — the least attractive of the bunch — and knew immediately that I would not come out on top of this challenge.For comparison, a photo comparing my recipes vs. a pain au chocolat purchased at Paul, a French patisserie chain, of which there are several locations in Strasbourg.Bet you can guess which ones are mine…Real french pastries next to my Americanized homemade version. Photo by Margaret Hoeschele.The Taste Test: The Best Croissant Recipe?At the end of the day, I gather my roommates for a taste test.I explain the experiment I’m doing, and tell them that they have to be honest.I add that I’m not all too impressed with the end result either, and that it’s okay if they don’t like them.Here were their responses, translated into English:Paul: Wow, that’s gross! No, they’re not good.Hamza: I don’t think this one’s cooked enough, but (referring to the recipe I compiled myself) it’s not a pain au chocolat.I implore them to choose one or the other of my creations.Paul: This one’s better (referring to the easy puff pastry recipe from Buzzfeed). It’s like bread with chocolate.Hamza: I can’t decide, I pick neither.I implore him further. “But if you had to pick one…”Hamza: I can’t. Neither one.So, there you have it, straight from the mouth of my French roommate turned food critic:“Neither one.”J’ai totalement raté. Failed. Baf. A swing and a miss.Yet, this was also a very telling experience for me, and an appropriate introduction into my new French lifestyle.The result reaffirms a quality — too often misunderstood and misinterpreted — that we can all appreciate within the French culture.To them, if something is worth doing, it’s worth doing well.There is, indeed, a reason as to why millions of tourists flock here every year to take in the impeccable scenery, the carefully aged wine, and the indulgent food:The French know what they’re doing, and they take pride in it.Thus, I’m not surprised and not too upset about this unsuccessful venture into my French kitchen.Translation:I’ll stick to my cookies and chocolate cakes and leave puff pastry for the professionals.At least, for now.It seems that these Frenchies do know exactly what they’re doing.Lucky for me, in Strasbourg, with its innumerable patisseries et boulangeries, I need only walk out of my front door to get my fix.Traditional patisseries.

Dough will be sticky. Place in lightly oiled bowl covered with plastic wrap and chill overnight.Rolling out the pastry dough. Photo by Pexels/PixabayStep 3:The next day, cut the chocolate filling into 1⁄2-inch pieces, sprinkle with the 2 tablespoons flour, and pound between two pieces of parchment with a rolling pin or beat in mixer with flour until smooth.Be sure to keep the butter cool. Shape into a 6×6 inch square about 1⁄2 inch thick.Return to the refrigerator if your butter feels too soft.Step 4:Place the dough on your lightly floured work surface.Roll the dough into a 7×14 inch rectangle.Start with the narrow edge nearest to you. Place the butter square on the bottom half of the dough, and fold the top half over the butter.Lightly seal the edges, and tap with the rolling pin to even out the thicknessStep 5:Turn the dough one-quarter turn so the fold is on the left and could open like a book.Roll the dough, keeping about the same width, to 24 inches in length. Fold the dough into thirds, as you would a letter.Tap the dough to even the thickness, and turn again so the fold is on the left side.You’ve just completed one turn!Step 6:Cover the dough lightly with plastic wrap and rest at room temperature for 20 minutes.If your room is warmer than 72°F, and you have concern about the dough becoming too soft, you can also rest the dough in the refrigerator.Step 7:Make two more turns, waiting at least 20 minutes between turns.Remember, if your room isn’t too warm, you don’t need to return to the refrigerator after each turn.Each time you fold the dough, you’re making more and more layers of butter and dough.When the butter heats and melts in the oven, the water in the butter will become steam.The steam pushes the layers of dough apart creating the flaky light layers of the croissants.Step 8:For croissants, divide the dough into two portions. Roll the first piece of dough into a 6×18 inch rectangle.Step 9:Cut triangles with a bottom width of about 3 inches.Roll the triangle to lengthen, cut a 1⁄2-inch slit on the bottom edge.Starting at the bottom, roll the dough towards the point, gently stretching the dough. Use both hands, splaying them apart as you roll.The slit will help widen the dough and create a traditional shape. It will take about three to four rolls to reach the end.Step 10:Place the croissants on a parchment-lined baking sheet, point side down.Repeat with the second portion of dough.Step 11: For pain au chocolat, cut rectangles measuring 3×4 inches.Place a chocolat baton at each end.Step 12:Roll/fold each end of the dough toward the center, then each end once again.This will create a scroll shape.Place the dough smooth side up, rolls down, on the baking sheet.When finished shaping, cover and allow the pastries to rise at room temperature for 1 hour.Step 13: While the dough is rising, preheat your oven to 350°F.Step 14:Just before baking, beat the egg in a small bowl with a fork.With a pastry brush, gently brush the tops of the croissants with egg wash.Try not to let the egg to drip down the sides of the croissant onto the pan.Step 15:Bake at 350°F, for 30 minutes.Rotate pan half way through if necessary.Step 16:To guarantee keeping croissants fresh, transfer pan to a cooking rack, and allow pastries to cool at least 30 minutes.If you serve the croissants too soon, the butter will not have cooled, and the pastry will have a greasy feel and taste.Step 17:Enjoy!Croissant Recipe VideoWondering how to make puff pastry at home, but prefer to learn the art of making these chocolate croissants through a video?The video above is a much watch!It shows an easy method for how to make flaky croissants in your own kitchen.You’ll learn the ins and outs of making croissants from scratch — including the key to rolling pastry dough and how to fold croissants.After watching, you’ll be making a finished pastry so good it could be French!When it comes to French baking, do you know how to make croissants with puff pastry?

35,https://therecipepatch.com/how-to-make-perfect-croissants/,"Add water, yeast, and sugar to a warm bowl.Add the 8 tablespoons of softened butter, salt and flour, to yeast mixture and mix well continuing to incorporate all ingredients together.Remove from bowl and continue to knead your dough with your hands on a clean surface. You do not want to add more flour or your dough will get too stiff. Knead for about 5 minutes until dough changes and become smooth and elastic. The kneading helps to build the strands of gluten to form an elastic dough to form the structure needing to make the perfect croissant. Form into a round ball.Place  ball of dough in a lightly greased bowl. Cover with a clean towel.Allow to rise in a warm spot until doubled in volume, taking up to two hours for the first rise. Uncover the dough and place on a lightly floured work surface and slightly flour your dough.Deflate the dough by patting it down and form into a long rectangle shape. Fold like a letter into thirds.Cover with plastic wrap and place in fridge to rest and rise slightly overnight. Resting the dough overnight helps the dough develop further gluten strands to strengthen and helps it rest overnight so it is no longer elastic or stretchy.While the dough is in the the fridge, Take your 16 tablespoons of softened butter in a quart size baggie to measure about 7 x 8 "".  Press the butter to fit the baggie and to blend the butter to form one piece. Place in fridge overnight to chill until dough is ready to roll out.The next day remove the butter from the fridge and allow to soften slightly before removing the dough. The dough and the butter should be the same constancy to make rolling easier and the layers even.Remove the dough and place it on a floured surface and roll it out to about 15 inch long by 7 inch wide rectangle.Remove butter and unwrap and place it on rolled out dough on one half. Take the ends of the dough fold it over the butter to wrap the dough around the butter to seal the butter in.Working from the center out roll out to about 25 inches by 8 inches wide. Brush off any extra.flour and fold 2/3 of the way up to the other corner and then fold the other side in to meet the edge. Roll out again to about 18 inches and fold in half like a book. That is a double turn.Repeat the same step and roll out until the rectangle is 24 x 8 inches. Fold the left end to the center and then the other end oner that. That is a simple turn. Wrap up the dough and refrigerate for one hour. The dough will form many layers that make the Croissants perfect that will bake into flaky layers.Remove dough from the fridge and use half the dough at a time while the other half remains in the fridge making sure the dough stays chilled at all times.Roll out the dough to a rectangle measuring 18 inches wide by 8 inches wide and 1/8 inch thick.With a sharp knife or pizza cutter divide the dough into 6 triangles to make 6 large croissant. If you would like to make sampler croissants, divide the dough into 12 smaller triangles.Repeat with the remaining dough.Roll out croissants starting at the wider edge and roll to the pointed tip.Place on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper.Make your egg wash by beating two eggs together in a small bowl. Brush your croissants with the egg wash.Cover with a towel and allow to rise again for 2-3 hours until the croissants have doubled in size and are puffed up. Brush the croissants with egg wash right before baking.Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.Place croissants in preheated oven and bake them at 400 degrees for 10 minutes.Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees and bake for another 10-15 minutes until golden brown.

Methodology
 
 
 





Mixing
This is a straight mix, add all your ingredients into a Spiral Mixer and mix for 4 minutes on low and 2 minutes on high. Reserve butter that has been scaled for your butter block. You will need this later!

 
 



Retarding
For our recipe, we have elected to refrigerate overnight. This will help cool down the dough and allow the glutens to relax.

 
 



Butter Block
Mix the butter that was reserved for the butter block with a Planetary Mixer until pliable. Once pliable, form butter into a flat block like shape between two layers of parchment paper. Refrigerate your newly formed butter block for approximately 1/2 hour until firm. The consistency should still be somewhat pliable.

 
 



Locking Butter Block
In our video we opted to use a manual method for locking the butter into the dough. You will want to make sure that your dough completely envelops the butter block. Be sure to overlap dough pieces so that a seam is made.

 
 



Laminating & Folding
Generally speaking, croissant dough must be laminated and folded three times. We opted to laminate once, then fold our dough and laminate a second time. We then refrigerated the dough for one hour and proceeded to laminate and fold the dough again. After the third fold, a final retarding phase is required.

 
 
 




Final Retarding Phase
As previously mentioned, after the third fold a final retarding phase is required. We opted to refrigerate our dough for one hour, however you can opt to refrigerate even longer – up to overnight.

 
 



Cutting
Once the final retarding phase is complete, take your folded piece of dough and perform a final lamination. Once the dough reaches the proper thickness, release the cutting attachment on your sheeter and proceed to cut the dough into triangular shapes.

 
 



Shaping
Once cut, take your triangular piece of dough and begin by stretching the dough. Once stretched, place it onto your work station. Proceed to roll into the familiar croissant shape. Optionally, you may also choose to curl/create a curved shape with your newly formed croissant.

 
 



Proofing
Allow your newly formed croissant to proof at room temperature for approximately 2 – 3 hours.

 
 



Baking
Bake in a preheated convection oven at 350°F for 15 – 20 minutes. Total baking times and temperatures may vary according to your oven, altitude and baking environment.

 
 



Cool & Serve
Enjoy your freshly baked croissants. Yields approximately 80, 5 oz. croissants.

In a big bowl, add polish and leaven to milk and stir.Mix in the rest of the ingredients. Cover with saran wrap and let stand for half an hour.Knead the dough for 5-10 seconds, cover and let ferment at room temperature for 1.5 hours, doing stretch and folds every half an hour. Stretch and fold is basically taking a corner of the dough, stretching and folding onto itself. Done once for each corner at a time.Transfer the dough into a plastic bag, flatten it into a rectangle, and refrigerate for 2-3 hours.Mold the butter and 1/2 cup of flour into a 8 x 12 inches rectangle. Do it quickly not letting the butter warm up. I use a pre-shaped envelope made from parchment paper for this task. I cut butter into small cubes, mix with flour, and place into the parchment paper envelope. Then, using a rolling pin, I pound, press and roll it to mold it into a rectangle. Put in the fridge.Take out the dough from the fridge and roll out into a 12 x 20 inches rectangle.Take out the block of butter from the fridge and lay it horizontally on the dough. It should cover about 2/3 of the length of the dough.Fold the left and the right side of the dough as you would fold a letter. Turn the dough 90 degrees and roll it out into a rectangle measuring about 12 x 20 inches. Do the fold again, cover with saran wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.Take the dough out of the fridge, roll out to a 12 x 20 inch rectangle and fold. This is the second turn.Refrigerate for 1 hour and do a third turn. If you want to use the dough later, place it into a freezer proof bag and freeze for up to three days. The night before using the dough, transfer it into refrigerator.After the third turn, if using immediately, let the dough relax in the fridge for half an hour, then take out and roll out to 12 x 24 inches rectangle. The dough should be about 1/2 inch thick.Using a pizza cutter, cut the dough in half, horizontally. Then cut vertically into about 3 or 4 equal pieces. Then cut each piece in half diagonally into triangles.Roll up each triangle, beginning at the widest side, and placing the narrow end on the bottom.Place rolled up pieces onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for about 2 hours. Croissants should increase in size by about 1.5 times.Preheat oven to 425 F.Prepare egg wash by whisking briskly egg yolks and cream or milk. Brush the tops of croissant with the egg wash.Bake for about 20-30 minutes , until the croissants are deep golden brown, crisp and flaky. Smaller size croissants may take 15 minutes to bake, so keep an eye on them, especially the first time you are making them.",croissant

Let it sit in a warm place for 10-15 minutes or until the yeast dissolves.In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Then pour in the warm yeast water.Using the hook attachment, mix the dough on medium speed until it begins to take shape. Toss in 1/2 cup of softened butter and continue mixing on medium high speed until the dough is smooth and well rounded.Transfer the dough into a bowl greased with oil. Lightly grease the dough with oil as well. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise for 2 hours or until it triples in size.Meanwhile prepare the butter slab. Start by cutting out 2 large sheets of parchment paper. Trace an 8x12 inch rectangle on each sheet. Place 1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) sliced butter in the middle of one sheet. Have the traced side down (you don't want to get any pencil marks on the butter).Place the second sheet on top (traced side up). Using a rolling pin, roll out the butter to the edges of the traced rectangle. Then place on a flat surface in the refrigerator.Once the dough is done rising, deflate it onto a floured surface and roll it out to a 28x14 inch rectangle. Fold over 2/3 of the left corner then bring in the right corner so it covers the other edge but doesn't quite reach the other side.Starting from the shorter edge fold the dough into thirds. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 6-8 hours (or overnight).In a bowl, combine 1 egg, 3/4 cup butter, and 1/2 tsp almond extract. Then blend in the 2 1/2 cups almond flour, 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, and 1 tsp corn starch. This will be the almond paste.Gently deflate the dough onto a floured surface and roll it out to a 25 x 9 inch rectangle. Place the chilled butter slab on the right half of the dough leaving at least 1 inch margin around the edges.Fold over the left (unbuttered) half and roll the dough out to a 30x12 inch rectangle. It helps to spread the butter by pressing down with the rolling pin along with rolling it out.Fold over 2/3 of the left corner then bring in the right corner so both edges touch.Roll the dough out to a 30x12 inch rectangle. Fold it in half like a book. Once its folded in half the dimensions should be 15 x 12 inches. Roll it out to 30 x 12 again.Then fold it into thirds. If the butter begins to melt, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. The size of the dough should be 12 x 8 inches before wrapping it in plastic wrap.Cut the chilled dough in half. Rewrap 1 halve and place it back in the refrigerator for later use. Roll the unwrapped dough into a 30x10 inch rectangle and cut out 9 triangles. Each triangle should be about 5 inches at the wide end, and about 1 inch at the narrow end.I like to make small slit in the middle of the wider ends so the croissant folds nicer, but thats totally optional. Fill the wider end of the triangles with 1 heaping tablespoon of the almond paste. Then roll the triangles toward the narrow end as you slightly pull the pointed end away.Place the croissants onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and let them rise in room temperature for 1-2 hours or until they double in size. Do not put them in a warm place to speed up the rising process. You don't want the butter to melt.Brush each croissant with egg wash and bake at 390 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 minutes, then 370 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 minutes. Baking time may vary depending on your oven.Mix the left over almond paste with a splash of milk and spread it over each croissant. Sprinkle sliced almonds over each croissant and bake for another 5 minutes at 370 degrees Fahrenheit. Once their cooled, dust powdered sugar over the top of each croissant.Remove the second half of the dough from the refrigerator and roll it out to a 30x10 inch rectangle. Cut out 9 triangles and repeat steps 14-17.",croissant

I have a theory. You ready for this one? Here it goes.
Home bakers have been agonizing over recreating two particular pastries in their own kitchens for years: the Croissant, and the French macaron.  Both are infamous for their laborious and finicky natures, but are beyond cherished by all who have ever consumed them. Because they’re delicious. And French. Or so my theory goes, at least.





















Since the French macaron still leaves me with feelings of frustration, anger, and just a general sense of grief about 50% of the time, I’m happy to say that they will NOT be the focus of this blog post. Instead, the much kinder and super buttery croissant is going to steal our attention, hearts, and tastebuds for now.
Before I really get into this, though, I’m going to be upfront with you all. These gave me a serious run for my money (which primarily went towards high quality, European-style cultured butter … one attempt after another). Let me also just be upfront in saying that all of those pounds of butter led to one valuable lesson after another (so they were totally worth it), which is why I can share the tried-and-true recipe that follows with you all.














I really do urge you to keep reading before you get to the recipe part so you can avoid all of the mistakes I made during my earlier attempts. Yup, that’s right – all of those amateur mistakes, I made them for you. And then I summed them all up in a little ‘tell-all’ so you don’t have to go through them, too! So read closely, know that your first attempt will likely not be absolutely perfect (but will still be so delicious), and you will never be terrorized by this French pastry ever again. French macarons, on the other hand…. those are another story for another day.




























Lesson No. 1: Not all butters are equal.
My first two attempts at croissants weren’t great – not horrible, but definitely not great. This completely changed, though, with my third attempt – which was when I finally gave in and spent almost $10 on one pound of butter. But this isn’t any ordinary old butter – I’m talking about European cultured butter here, folks. And you’re going to want to splurge a little on some, too, if you’re looking to make some croissants that 1) puff up nice and tall as they become bronzed, flakey, and beautiful in the oven, and 2) taste AMAZING.
European cultured butter has a higher butterfat content (at least 82%) than American style butter. The butter I’ve become pretty smitten with throughout this process is Organic Valley’s European Style Cultured butter (*FYI, this is not a sponsored post, I just really love this butter!), which is at least 84% butterfat. So what exactly does this higher butterfat mean for your baked goods? A couple of things – first, it means your butter has a lower water content, and less water and more fat in your butter means you’ll get those pie crusts, biscuits, croissants, etc. nice and flakey, just how you like em. This butter’s also going to be softer and melt at a lower temperature, which also contributes to that highly sought after flakiness.
Flakey pastry aside, though, European style butters also have an incredible and rich flavor – seriously, I was not prepared for how amazing this butter tastes, even smells, compared to what I usually buy. I remember unwrapping this butter for the first time and becoming downright distracted by how good it smelled. I had no idea butter could smell like this – so good, you guys. And when you’re making a pastry like croissants where the butter is basically the shining star, you better be using a butter that tastes really great.





















Lesson No. 2: Laminating = a lot of (kind of annoying) little rules. 
Okay, so that wording above may be a bit harsh. Laminating a dough really isn’t that bad. But finally nailing this part of the process involved a lot of trial and error type learning and had me feeling a bit rattled before I finally got it down. Because laminating is so crucial to making consistently great croissants, I’m going to break this section out rule-by- rule for you.

Make sure your butter block and your dough are on the same page. And by ‘same page,’ I mean same consistency. During my first trial runs at making croissants, I relied on the temperature of the butter block to determine when it was ready to be laminated into the yeasted dough (the ideal temp is said to be around 62ºF). But, each time I started rolling out the dough-encased butter, I noticed that my butter block wasn’t being rolled into thin, even sheets between the layers of dough. Instead, it was breaking and being rolled into thin shards of butter between those layers of dough. And in some cases, was even breaking through the actual dough.What was my problem here? Let me tell you – I was paying all of my attention to the the temperature of the butter block, when I should have been paying equal attention to the yeasted dough. Now when I go into laminating, I completely dismiss temperature all together. What I check for is that the butter block and the dough have the same softness/firmness; this ensures the butter won’t 1) break into shards and tear through the dough (if the butter is too hard/cold), or 2) get mixed into the dough throughout the whole laminating process (if the butter is too soft/warm). To test if your butter block and dough are ready to be laminated, just gently press each with your fingers to see if they’re on the same page.
Use your flour wisely. You definitely want to flour your work space when you’re laminating and rolling out your dough, but just enough to prevent it from sticking. Use too much flour, and you’ll dry out your dough, which will cause it to crack/tear (especially around the edges) and the butter layers to burst free. I like to start off with a really light sprinkling of flour on the bottom of the board and on top of the dough, and then periodically check to make sure it’s not sticking and add more flour little by little as needed.
Listen to your dough. This sounds silly and kind of cliche, I know, but if you want to avoid a full on rebellion from your dough – complete with rips and tears and butter that refuses to stay in its designated layers (complete anarchy, basically) – then this is a rule you won’t want to ignore. In the recipe, I have dimensions included that you’ll want to try to roll your dough out to throughout the laminating process. Don’t view these as strict measurements that you have to reach, though. View them more as ideal guidelines. The truth is, some days my dough is really cooperative and wants to be rolled out into a nice big 14×24″ rectangle, and some days it’s just not feeling it. Like any other yeast dough, it’s going to be affected by certain environmental factors that aren’t always consistent day by day (e.x. humidity). So if you reach a point where your dough just doesn’t want to be rolled/stretched out any further, just give it a 10-minute rest, try again, and if it still isn’t having it, then stop rolling, make your folds and put it back in the fridge to chill out before continuing with the next roll/fold session. If you try to force it, it’ll throw it’s go-to’s at you: rips, tears, and butter anarchy (you don’t want these things, trust me).






















Lesson No. 3: A slow proof is the only proof. 
Croissants are not a quick kitchen project. They just aren’t. This is the type of recipe you’re going to want to spread out over the course of your weekend. The yeasted dough needs to hang out in the fridge overnight, laminating requires a series of 5 roll-outs/foldings (with fridge time between each), and the final rise will take a good 2-3 hours before you can bake them. I’ve tried rushing this final rise part before, and I regret it. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. There’s just no way around it – at least none that I’ve found, yet. Usually when I let my yeast doughs rise, I give them a some help by placing them in a semi-preheated oven (heat to its lowest temp, turn off, and then you have a nice, warm place that most yeast doughs love).
Try that with croissants, though, and the next time you see them they’ll be sitting in pools of their own melted butter. Case and point:







Despite how big and puffy these croissants got during this proofing period, the butter spillage kept them from getting nice and tall in the oven. These also lacked that really great crackly/flakey exterior that we all know and love. Trust me when I say you’ve come too far by this point to be left with two trays of croissants that you know won’t bake up perfectly. While you can’t let these proof in a semi-preheated oven, there is something you can do to help speed this part up a little bit. Still place them in the oven (turned off and completely unheated), and on the bottom of the oven place a cake pan or a casserole dish filled with boiling water. This will heat up that oven just enough to get it to around 70-ishºF, which is just warm enough to prompt them to rise, but not so warm that the layers of butter will melt. I usually refill the pan/dish with freshly boiled water after the first hour, and once again another 40 minutes after that.





















Lesson No. 4: Practice makes perfect!
Ok, so this sounds even more cliche than “listen to your dough” — I realize this, I really do. BUT, this may actually be the most important lesson of them all. My first batch of croissants missed all of the marks. My second batch still came out flat, but I got closer to the flakey layers I was looking for. My third batch was *almost* perfect, they just weren’t quite as tall as they could’ve been if I would have been more patient and allowed a slower proof time. My fourth and fifth times, though, those were darn near perfect. Perfectly bronzed, perfectly crackly/flakey top, perfectly flakey throughout so they could be torn apart layer by buttery layer as they were devoured. A kitchen success has never tasted so good. Once you get the laminating down, though, you’re going to have to turn your attention towards the shaping process, which is something I’m still working on getting down just so. If this all sounds like a process to you, it is – but a good one! One that involves a lot of great tasting butter. Like I said before, the process is worth it here.




























Okay. I know that was a lot. But I really hope all of this information makes you feel like you’re armed with some helpful knowledge before conquering your croissant fears, especially if this is your first run at it. I can promise you, though, making a perfectly good croissant is not an impossible feat. It will take a bit of practice, but even if your first run at these isn’t *perfect,* you’ll see serious improvements one batch after another. And, I’ll tell ya – there’s nothing quite as satisfying as seeing SO MANY thin little layers of butter/dough after cutting a perfectly laminated block of croissant dough in half. And then seeing those layers still intact after all of your little labors of love have baked up into flakey, golden brown, and crackly topped perfection. It may be lot of work, but it’s so worth it.
If you’re feeling a little adventurous and are looking for a weekend baking project, you may want to consider adding croissants onto your weekend agenda. I think it’s about time we all cross this one off of our bucket lists… French macarons can stay on that list just a little bit longer…







Croissants
Yield: 14-16 large croissants
For the dough:
2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast
3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup sugar
2 teaspoons salt
1 1/4 cups whole milk, warmed (I microwave it in a glass measuring cup at 30-second intervals until it reaches 120-130ºF)
For the butter block:
1 lb. unsalted butter (European-style cultured butter is best — I like to use Organic Valley’s European-style butter)
2 Tablespoons all-purpose flour
For the egg wash:
1 egg
1 Tablespoon water
Directions:
1. Make the dough 
In the bowl of a stand mixer, mix together the yeast, flour, sugar, and salt. Fitted with a dough hook and at its lowest speed, add the warm milk and mix for 2 minutes (scraping the flour from the sides and bottom of the bowl after about a minute to make sure it all gets mixed up evenly); you’ll have a soft, moist dough that forms on the hook.
On a high speed, mix the dough for another 4 minutes until its smooth, elastic, similar to the consistency of softened butter, and no longer sticky. Add more flour (carefully, though – tablespoon by tablespoon — if needed to reach this point). Remove the dough from the mixer and place in a gallon-sized zip lock bag (or wrap loosely in plastic wrap) and allow to rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. Place the dough in the fridge for 8 hours or overnight.
2. Make the butter block 
To make the butter block, switch to the paddle attachment of your stand mixer and beat the butter and flour on high speed until it’s evenly mixed and smooth, about 2 minutes. Onto a large piece of plastic wrap, scrape out the butter and spread into approximately a 4×8 inch rectangle that’s about 3/4 – 1 inch thick. Wrap in plastic wrap and keep in the fridge until you’re ready to laminate.
3. Laminate your dough
*Before you laminate the dough, gently press the butter block and your dough to see if they’re equally firm; I usually have to let my butter block sit out at room temperature for 15-30 minutes before I jump into laminating.
When your butter block and dough are about the same consistency/firmness, remove the dough from the fridge and onto a lightly floured work surface. Roll into a 9-inch square. Fit the butter block onto one side of your dough square (it should take up half of the square with about a 1/2-inch border around the edges). Fold the other half of the dough over the butter block and pinch the edges of the dough together to tightly seal the butter in the dough to create a package.
Now you can roll this dough/butter package into a 14×24 inch rectangle — begin by gently smacking it with your rolling pin, beginning in the middle and then up and down the length of it, to make the butter layer more malleable and easier to roll out evenly. Be sure to check periodically that your dough isn’t sticking to your work surface and re-flour (lightly) as needed.
Fold the dough into thirds (think ‘business letter style’) so that you have a rectangle that’s about 8×14 inches. Brush off excess flour, wrap in plastic wrap, and move to the fridge to chill and rest for 45 minutes – 1 hour. Congratulations — you’ve just completed your first of five series of rolls/folds!
Follow those last two steps of rolling the dough into a 14×24 inch rectangle, folding into thirds, and then refrigerating/resting three more times. (This might seem like a lot, but all of those amazing layers you’re going to get out of this will be completely worth it!).
For your fifth and final roll/fold, go ahead and roll the dough into a 14×24 inch rectangle and fold into thirds again. And then finish by folding the two ends so that they meet in the middle, and then along that middle crease where the ends meet, fold in half. Brush off the excess flour, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 2 hours or up to overnight.
4. Shape your croissants
After your block of laminated dough has rested and chilled, remove from the fridge; cut this block in half. Leaving one half wrapped in plastic wrap in the fridge, place the other half onto a lightly floured work surface and roll into a rectangle that measures roughly 7×20 inches. From here, you can choose to form your croissants in the classic crescent-like shape, or you can shape and fill them as I did to make ham and cheese (aka prosciutto and manchego) filled croissants — shaping instructions for both are included below.
[For crescent-shaped croissants:]
Using either a sharp knife or a pizza cutter, and working along the length of your dough, slice into triangles with bases that measure between 2 and 3 inches (depending on how large you want your croissants to be). You’ll get between 8 and 10 triangles and two half triangles (one on each end); you can either mend these two halves together or discard them.
To shape the croissant, take one of the triangles and with one hand at the base and the other about 2 inches away from the tip, gently stretch the dough without tearing it; you’ll want to try stretching the dough so that it’s about twice its length, but if the dough is threatening to tear, then only stretch it out as much as it will allow. After it’s stretched, place back onto the work surface and beginning with the base of the triangle, gently but firmly roll all the way down to the tip. Place the croissant on a parchment lined baking sheet with the tip underneath. Repeat with the remaining triangles of dough, lining the sheet so there’s enough room for each one to double to triple in size without growing into each other.
Repeat the last two steps with the remaining half of dough.
[For the prosciutto and manchego filled croissants:]
Using either a sharp knife or a pizza cutter, and working along the length of your dough, slice evenly into 7 rectangles (each will be about 2 1/2 – 3 inches in width).
Working with one piece of dough at a time, use a rolling pin to widen the width to 3 1/2 – 4 inches (I did this because the pieces of cheese I used to fill these with were about 4 inches or a little bit longer in length and I didn’t want them to stick out too much; depending on what you’re filling your croissants with, feel free to omit this step). Place 1 to 2 pieces of prosciutto onto the dough, overlapping/bunching it slightly towards the end. Then place one piece of cheese (I used manchego and it was insanely delicious — I cut my wedge of manchego into approximately 1/2 x 4 inch logs) on top of that, right alongside the width of the dough. Beginning at that end, start to roll into a log shape; stop midway and place another piece of cheese and then continue rolling. Place onto a parchment lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough, lining the sheet so there’s enough room for each one to double to triple in size without growing into each other.
Repeat the last two steps with the remaining half of dough.
5. Proof and bake [*the following instructions will not vary based on how you choose to shape and/or fill your croissants]
Once your croissants are shaped and lining your baking sheets, lightly brush with an egg wash made by whisking together 1 egg and 1 Tablespoon of water. Then loosely cover each sheet of croissants with lightly greased plastic wrap and a large kitchen towel on top of that. Place the sheets in an unheated oven and place a dish/pan of boiling water on the bottom of the oven; this pan of boiling water is essentially turning your oven into a proof box that will warm up just enough to get your croissants to rise, but not warm enough to melt those layers of butter you worked so hard to get! Allow to proof for 2-3 hours, or until the croissants are puffy and have doubled to tripled in size. *I like to refill the pan with freshly boiled water after about 40-60 minutes, and then again about 40 minutes after that.
When your croissants are proofed, remove from the oven (and remove that pan of water, too), and preheat your oven to 425ºF. While your oven is preheating, lightly brush the croissants with another coating of egg wash.
Place your croissants in the preheated oven (at this point, using a spray bottle filled with tap water, I add a couple of sprits of water to the oven before closing the door to help with the steam to make sure they bake up nice and tall) and bake for 5 minutes. Then decrease the oven temperature to 400ºF and bake for another 5 minutes, and then decrease the oven temperature to 375ºF and bake for a final 5 minutes. *If your oven does not heat evenly, be sure to rotate the baking sheets halfway throughout baking to make sure the brown evenly.
Remove from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool a bit — these are definitely at their best when they’re still warm. Enjoy!

40,https://www.veganosity.com/vegan-french-croissants/,"Heat the almond milk in the microwave for twenty seconds.Pour one cup of the almond milk into a shallow bowl. Pour the active dry yeast on top of the almond milk and mix for a couple seconds. Now let the almond milk and yeast set for approximately five minutes, or until the yeast begins to foam. The yeast must foam in order for the croissants to turn out. If the yeast does not foam try again.Put the milk-yeast mixture into a stand mixer. Pour the rest of the almond milk into the mixing bowl along with the caster sugar and mix briefly to combine.In a separate bowl, sift the flour to remove any lumps. Slowly add the flour to the almond milk-yeast mixture in quarter cup increments. The dough is ready when it looks soft and sticky. The amount of flour can vary. The amount of flour we usually end up with is somewhere between 2 ¼ cups and 2 ½ cups. After the dough appears soft and sticky, add the salt and mix to combine.Sprinkle a quarter cup of the flour onto a clean surface and prepare a plate that is dusted with about 1 tbsp of flour. Dump the dough onto the floured surface and kneed for approximately two minutes. Then work the dough into a ball. If the ball starts to fall slightly, the dough was made correctly.Place the dough on the plate and cut an X into the top of the dough. Sprinkle another tablespoon of flour on top of the dough and place it in the fridge. Let the dough rest in the fridge for at least one hour.While the dough is resting, take the butter and put it in your stand mixer. Beat the butter until it is completely smooth. This should only take about a minute or two. Now beat in 2 tbsp of the flour. Mix until uniform in texture.Put the butter on the floured surface and shape it into a 4 inch x 4 inch square. Wrap the butter-flour mixture in plastic wrap and place it in the fridge to cool. The butter-flour block should be hard to the touch when you take it out of the fridge.Once the dough has been in the fridge for an hour, remove it and put it back on the floured surface. Now, get ready to roll out this dough is some semi-complicated ways.You’re going to roll out your dough so that the center has enough room to hold that 4x4 butter square. Roll your dough into a large square, much larger than the butter block.Place the butter block in the center of the dough like shown below and fold in each of the petals. It should look like a nice little present.Here’s the fun part, take your rolling pin and lightly smack the butter-dough wrap. We hit it about eight times to make sure the butter is evenly distributed throughout the dough. Now roll the dough into an 18 by 10 rectangle.Now we’re going to make our next fold. Imagine the dough in three sections. You’re going to make the fold so that the end result looks like a thick square, not a long rectangle. Fold the first third of the dough over, following by the second third. Lightly roll the dough to make sure the layers stick together.Pop the dough back in the fridge for an hour and a half.Remove the dough from the fridge and roll it back out into another long rectangle. Do another tri-fold and set that dough back into the fridge for a minimum of six hours.When the six hours are up, take the dough out of the fridge and roll it out into a rectangle that is ten inches long and as wide as you can roll it out. Cut the dough into triangles that have a base of approximately four to five inches, depending on how large you want your croissants. Take the triangles and slightly stretch them out, just so they’re a couple inches longer. Starting from the widest side of the triangle, roll the triangles into crescent shapes.Transfer the croissants to a parchment lined baking sheet and brush each of them with the rest of the almond milk. Let the dough sit out until the croissants double in size, this should take approximately two hours.Preheat the oven to 400°F (204°C). Bake the croissants for ten minutes at this temperature. Then drop the oven temperature to 375°F (190°C) and bake for fifteen minutes or until golden brown on top.See the step by step instruction photos above.&nbsp;",croissant

42,https://alexandracooks.com/2013/03/26/prosciutto-gruyere-croissants/,"Make the pastry: If you are using instant yeast or fresh yeast and have planned ahead such that you know you will be refrigerating the dough over night: Pour the water and milk into a measuring cup and add the egg, beating with a fork to mix. Set aside. If you need to speed up your dough-making process or want to make sure your yeast is alive and well: Sprinkle yeast over the warm water and milk with a little bit of the sugar (I take 1/2 teaspoon from the 1 tablespoon) and let stand until the mixture starts to foam a little bit. Then, beat egg with a fork until broken up and add to milk-yeast mixture. Beat mixture with fork again until just combined. Set aside.Place a large bowl near your food processor. Then put the flour, yeast (if you haven&#8217;t mixed it with the milk), salt and sugar in the processor, and give it one quick whizz just to mix. Add the cold slices of butter and process briefly so that the butter is cut up a little. You still want visible chunks of butter about least 1/2 inch in size — about 10 to 15 short pulses.Empty the contents of the food processor into the large bowl, then add in the milk-egg mixture. Use your hands or a rubber spatula to mix the ingredients together, but don’t overdo it: expect to have a gooey mess with some butter lumps pebbling it. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, put in the refrigerator, and leave overnight or up to 4 days. (Note: If you have &#8220;bloomed&#8221; your yeast as noted in step 1, you can get away with two hours in the fridge at this step.)To turn the dough into pastry, take it (or half of it — I find it easier to work with half the amount of dough at this step) out of the refrigerator, let it get to room temperature (or don&#8217;t if you are pressed for time) and roll the dough out into a 20-inch square. (Note: Don&#8217;t worry too much about inches here — just try to roll the dough out into a large square that is relatively thin. Also, you will need to lightly dust your work surface with flour and add more flour as needed to your rolling pin and board.) Fold the dough square into thirds, like a business letter, turning it afterward so that the closed fold is on your left, like the spine of a book. Roll the dough out again into a large square (mine always looks more like a rectangle), repeating the steps above 3 times.Wrap the dough in plastic wrap, and put it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes (you can keep it in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, if you haven’t already done so at the earlier stage), or refrigerate half to use now and put the other half in the freezer to use later. (Note: If you are pressed for time, skip this 30 minute chill time.)Roll the croissants: Roll the dough out again into a large square or rectangle. Cut the dough in half lengthwise and crosswise. Then cut each each of the four pieces created in half diagonally. (See pictures for guidance.)Lay a piece of prosciutto or smoked ham over two-thirds (or more) of each triangle, leaving the pointed tip uncovered. Scatter the batons of Gruyère over top. Starting with the wide base of each triangle, carefully roll up each croissant, encasing the ham and cheese as you go.Place the rolled croissants on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and brush with the egg wash. Leave them to rise until they double in size, about 1 1/2 hours; they should then feel like marshmallow. (Note: With both the cheese danishes and these croissants, it never looks as though the pastries have doubled nor does the texture of the dough feel as fluffy marshmallow. I just stick them in the oven after 1.5 hours regardless of how they look.)Meanwhile, about 30 minutes before they&#8217;re ready to be cooked, preheat the oven to 350°F.

This is part of a two-part post. Click here to read part one, the history of croissants.

It's time to talk about the why. I think there is nothing more fascinating than understanding why you do something that you do. I've always heard people say they prefer cooking over baking because when cooking you can alter the recipe as you choose and just go where the spirit takes you. While this is true, if you have the proper knowledge and understanding backing up your alterations, you can apply this same technique to baking with excellent results. Since baking is so scientific, you can control very specifically for the results you want. I think that is so cool. 



Before we get much further into this recipe and/or this blog, I should probably tell you an important fact about myself. I am NOT trying to post quick, easy, 30-min-or-less recipes on this blog. I personally do not search out those recipes, and I am not going to start in an attempt to appeal to a wider audience. Though I don't want to post easy recipes, I do want to make it easier for readers to understand how to follow the more difficult recipes. I want to share the tips I wish I knew before trying the recipe. I want others to feel the same joy I feel during and after a particularly formidable recipe, the satisfaction of looking at an exquisite piece of food and thinking to yourself ""I made that."" Though these recipes may not be harried weeknight favorites, they will be delicious, and most definitely will be Instagram-worthy. So there's always that.



I think the best way to discuss croissant-making is to just break down the recipe. I'm going to post the recipe in its entirety at the bottom, but first I'm going to pull snippets and discuss them. Please don't bake off this discussion part because I'm not going to discuss every single step, just the ones that bear discussing.

Please don't get freaked out by how long the recipe is. Take a few minutes to read straight through the thing, from start to finish (which is really what I would recommend doing anytime you bake anything.. I like to read the recipe and visualize myself taking each step), and you'll see that the reason it is so long is because it's quite repetitive. Basically, if you know how to laminate dough, you're golden. And if you don't, you're about to become an expert! Also, heads up, this is a two day recipe. The dough has to rest in the fridge overnight before the final shaping. Please plan ahead.





Laminating the dough, which basically means rolling it out and folding it and rolling it out and folding it many, many times to create layers of alternating dough and butter (YUM), is the defining technique of croissants. Without the lamination of the dough, your end product would not be a croissant - though it may resemble a kipferl. Each time you roll out and fold the dough, it's called a turn. Most modern croissant recipes call for three or four turns, which create 27 or 81 layers respectively. However, in Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Julia Child calls for 6 turns of the croissant dough aka 729 layers in total. HOLY SHEET. 



If you are a perfectionist or you aspire to be like Julia (don't we all?) or for some reason you just want to laminate your dough 6 times...don't. What?! Well, here's the deal. Unless you're making giant croissants (like, for example, the amazing croissants at Dan the Baker in Columbus, OH), laminating the dough so many times for a smaller croissant will likely result in a less open crumb. And more importantly for the newer croissant bakers out there, more layers = more opportunities to accidentally tear the dough and cause ***leaky butter***. And no one likes leaky butter. Especially when it completely messes up what would have been perfectly lovely layers of croissants. So for now, lets just stick with a still impressive 27-81 layers of dough and butter.



Alright, with that said, let's dig into the recipe! I'm not going to explain EVERY step, just the more confusing ones. If you don't want/need this tutorial please feel free to skip all of this. The recipe is posted at the bottom. Before reading this tutorial, it will be helpful to scroll to the bottom and read the recipe in its entirely, and then come back up and read my explanation for some of the complicated parts.

Jumping into the tutorial, we will first discuss some of the ingredients:



Ingredients:

4 1/4 cups (21 1/4 ounces) all-purpose flour ( King Arthur Flour is recommended)

12 oz (24 tablespoons) unsalted European-style butter, very cold

4 teaspoons instant or rapid-rise yeast 



Obviously, flour, butter, and yeast are not the only ingredients. Most of the ingredients are quite straightforward, but these three are more specific and I wanted to explain why. The reason that King Arthur flour (KAF) is specified over other flour brands is because of its protein content. As you may or may not know, the variation in protein content is the main distinguisher between cake flour, all-purpose (AP) flour, bread flour, and high-gluten flour. I'm definitely going to do a post on this later because it is fascinating, but for now, suffice it to say, KAF's AP flour has a higher protein content than most AP flours (it's 11.7 percent if you were curious) which is perfect for croissants. It's strong enough to support the many layers but not too strong that you'll break your arms trying to roll it out. 



The other specified ingredient, European-style butter, is also very important in order to get those distinct layers that we so crave and admire in a croissant. Though European-style is definitely a splurge, it's worth it. European-style butter (I often purchase the Kerrygold brand because that's the only unsalted European-style butter I can find at my local grocery. It must, I repeat, MUST be unsalted.) differs from American-style butter in the fat to water ratio. For butter to be considered butter in the US, by law it must be at least 80 percent butterfat. For European-style, it must be at least 82 percent (some go up to about 86 percent, average is 83 percent). You don't think two percent is worth the extra $3? Flip it around and look at the water content. That's 20 percent vs. 14-18 percent water, a 10-30 percent difference in the total amount of water in the butter. As you may know from pie dough struggles, too much water = tough pastry. The extra water acts as a binding agent in the dough, which stops the layers from rising as well or becoming as distinct as you may like. More butterfat also means it will remain solid longer in the oven, again leading to more layers in your croissant.



Lastly, the yeast. Please, please, please use instant/rapid-rise yeast (they're basically the same thing). It is SO MUCH EASIER than active dry yeast. This is a topic that I cover in great (probably way too much) detail in a two part series on yeast (part one here and part two here). I don't think anyone should be using active dry anymore. If my generous use of the word 'please' isn't convincing you, consider this: subbing one for the other does not occur at a simple 1:1 ratio so you will A) have to know the ratio or risk messing up your beautiful croissants, and B) have to do MATH to sub in active dry. There- did that sway you?!





Now that we've talked about [some] of the ingredients, I'm going into the process. Again, I'm not going to explain every step, just those that I think need it.

2. Whisk in yeast and transfer milk mixture to bowl of a stand mixer. 
3.  Add the flour, sugar, and salt  to the bowl with milk mixture. Using dough hook, knead on low speed until a cohesive dough forms, which should take about 2 to 3 minutes. 
4. Increase mixer speed to medium-low and knead for 1 more minute. 

If you don't own a Kitchenaid or some kind of stand mixer, you're not alone. I spent years baking all sorts of things (including a wedding cake for 200 people) with just a hand mixer and sheer determination. Luckily, making this recipe by hand is a snap. As my grandma always says: ""people who knead their own bread and hang their own laundry are more emotionally healthy."" Even if you do have a stand mixer, maybe you should knead out some of your stress with this dough. Just go ahead and knead it by hand until it feels smooth and satiny. If that's not specific enough for you, I'd say to knead it for about 7-10 minutes.

BUTTER BLOCK
1. While the dough chills, fold a 24-inch length of parchment paper in half to make a 12-inch rectangle. Fold over the 3 open sides of the rectangle to form an 8-inch square with enclosed sides. Crease folds firmly. Set aside.

I'm going to be honest, the butter block directions seem a little confusing at first. Some recipes take a simpler approach by mixing the dough together, cutting in large chunks of butter, and quickly blitzing it so that the dough is still dotted with large pieces of butter. They will then proceed straight to laminating. While this approach definitely addresses the butter part of the butter block, it does not translate to the same lovely layers in your finished product. Other recipes are not as precise with the measurements of the butter block. However, I find this technique to be quite simple once you actually start doing it, and perfect for matching up the dough/butter ratio correctly. I mean, if you're going to the trouble of spending hours making these things, might as well be precise about it, right?




2. Place 24 tablespoons (12 oz) very cold butter directly on counter and beat with rolling pin for about 60 seconds (or so) until butter is just pliable but not warm. You can then fold butter on itself using a bench scraper and form it roughly into a 6 inch square.

Beating the butter is actually very fun! You literally just set out the butter on your (clean) counter and start whacking it with the rolling pin. (Would not recommend doing this late at night if you share a wall with your neighbors- it's quite loud.) The whole point is to make the butter pliable enough so that you can get it into an 8x8 square and incorporate it into your dough without it melting from being too hot OR cracking from being too cold.


3. Unfold parchment envelope you set aside earlier. Using bench scraper, transfer butter to center of the parchment paper, refolding at creases to enclose. 

4. Turn packet over, with flaps underneath, and using a rolling pin on top of the parchment paper, gently roll until butter fills the parchment square. Make sure you have an even thickness. 

Rolling the butter evenly into every corner of the parchment paper is oddly satisfying. Just trust me.. and let me know if you disagree after you've tried it.

(Don't forget, I'm not covering every step here - just the interesting/confusing ones)



LAMINATE: 

1. After the dough has been in the fridge for at least 2 hours (the original recipe calls for putting the dough in the freezer for 30 min as well, which I would say is optional), transfer dough to lightly floured counter and roll into 17 x 8-inch rectangle with the long side parallel to edge of counter. 

Use a ruler. No, I'm not kidding. Of course you don't have to, but I've found it very helpful, especially since at this point you are trying to perfectly match up the butter block to the dough. I have a special ""baking ruler"" which is just a 99c ruler I only use for baking and keep in the kitchen. I've also found the ruler helpful for knocking the sides of the dough so that your sides are straighter and edges are not rounded.







2. Unwrap butter packet and place the butter in center of dough. 
3. Fold both sides of dough over butter so they meet in center. Press seam together with fingertips. 

4. With rolling pin, press firmly on each open end of the dough and butter packet (top and bottom) to seal edges. 

Thanks to your RULER, the sides should match up perfectly over the dough! You then want to make sure to seal the edges (by pressing with the rolling pin) so the butter doesn't seep out during the next part. If the butter begins to seep out and get all over the sides of the dough, this will inhibit the rise and distinction of your layers.


5. Roll out lengthwise into a 24 x 8-inch rectangle. Fold into thirds like a business letter, so you get an 8-inch square. 

You are now beginning your first turn. As I mentioned earlier, a 'turn' is a term used when laminating dough (which is what you are doing now). To complete a turn you will roll out the dough to the prescribed length and width (24 x 8 in this recipe) and then fold it in thirds. That's all there is to it - that's a turn. Easy peasy. This recipe calls for three turns. Again, I use a ruler for this- literally roll the dough out to be 24x8 and then all you have to is measure 8 inches in and it will be folded in perfect thirds. While you may choose not to use a ruler, you should still do your darndest to make sure it's folded in even thirds. If you don't, some parts of your dough will not have as many layers as other parts do and the butter will not be as evenly distributed. When you fold the sides of the dough in, letter-style, make sure to brush off any extra flour as you go. We floured the countertop earlier so that the dough wouldn't stick to it, but we want to incorporate as little extra flour as possible into the dough itself - extra flour sitting on top of the dough will mess up those layers!


6. Turn dough 90 degrees counterclockwise. Roll the dough out lengthwise again into 24 x 8-inch rectangle and fold into thirds, again like a business letter. 

Now you are going to do your second turn. Exactly the same as what we just did. Now there are 9 layers of dough and butter...mmm! You should expect the dough to be more difficult to roll out with each turn because the strands of gluten within the dough are connecting with each other and becoming stronger as you work with the dough. Just count it as your daily strength training. And you are almost done for the day- you're just going to put the dough in the freezer for a quick 30 minutes because at this point it is probably getting dangerously close to room temperature after those two turns. The last thing we want is a room temp dough, because that means the butter in it is room temp, and that means it's getting ready to melt into the dough and become a cohesive buttery dough, instead of alternating layers of butter and dough. If at any point during this part of the recipe you become concerned your dough is getting too warm, throw it in the fridge or freezer for 20-30 minutes.

After your dough has chilled in the freezer, you'll do your last turn- just repeat exactly what you did in the above steps.

Starting below, we are on day 2 of this recipe:




2. Generously dust half of the dough with flour. Fold upper half of dough over lower floured half. 

3. Using ruler, mark dough at 3-inch intervals along bottom edge with bench scraper (you should have 5 marks). 

4. Move ruler to top edge of dough, measure in 1 1/2 inches from left, then use this mark to measure out 3-inch intervals (you should have 6 marks). 

Alright. This is the part of the recipe where it gets extremely wordy describing a process that won't take more than five minutes. I thought about making it more concise but I find the thorough explanation to be useful. Just read it over before you start and you'll find it's quite simple. Here I will again recommend a ruler.. that is if you want to have uniformly shaped croissants that bake up evenly rather than ending up with some overdone and some underdone. If you don't have a bench scraper to mark the dough with (I highly recommend purchasing one, they are about $5 and useful in many recipes), just use a small knife or pizza wheel. Try to work quickly so the dough stays as cold as possible - you'll thank me in step 6.


I filled these particular croissants with prosciutto and gruyere. Mmm.


5. Starting at lower left corner, use sharp pizza wheel, bench scraper, or knife to cut dough from mark to mark. You will have 12 triangles and 5 diamonds. Either discard scraps or place scraps next to each other in a small tart pan to rise.

6. Unfold diamonds and cut in half to make 10 triangles (you will have 22 equal-size triangles in total).


I never discard my scraps- I prefer to save them and do whatever I want with with them, such as pressing them into a small tart pan, layering with fillings of choice, and topping with more scraps (and baking up into a deliciously ugly blob). Of course you are welcome to discard them, but it hurts me to think about that expensive European butter and hours of hard work and love being tossed in the trash.

When you get to step 6, hopefully you don't have difficulty unfolding the diamonds as I did the first time I made these. If you've been working quickly and you floured the dough well before folding, it should still be cool enough to be fairly differentiated and will separate easily. If not, just work carefully and repeat ""I can do this I can do this I can do this"" over and over in your head. Or put the dough in the fridge (cover loosely with plastic wrap) for 20 minutes and then try again.



8. Cut 1/2-inch slit in center of short side of triangle. Grasp triangle by 2 corners on either side of slit and stretch gently, then stretch bottom point, again gently. Brush any extra flour off the dough.

9. Place triangle on counter so point is facing you. Fold down both sides of slit. Roll top of triangle partway toward point. Gently grasp point with 1 hand and stretch again. Resume rolling, tucking point underneath. 

10. Curve ends gently toward each other to create crescent. Repeat with remaining triangles.

For step 8, you want a cut a small slit at the base of the triangle so that you can fold out from your slit and roll up the croissant in that fashion. This serves to elongate the croissant so that it can take the shape of a classic croissant, with the edges slightly tucked in. If you are more of a visual person, this video is only one and a half minutes long (and you really only have to watch the first 30ish seconds) and illustrates exactly what I am trying to say. The chef also shares some interesting information about French croissants that I did not know!





14. In small bowl, whisk together egg, water, and a pinch of salt.

15. Brush croissants with egg wash. Place croissants in hot oven and reduce temperature to 375 degrees F. 

To be honest, I often forget about the egg wash when making pastries. In some recipes it makes a big difference in browning, but there is so much butter in this recipe that the croissants have no trouble browning up nicely without any egg wash. However, the egg wash does give the finished product that particular shininess that one associates with the top of pastries, so if that is particularly important to you, by all means, do not forget the egg wash!


16.  Bake for 10 minutes, then switch and rotate baking sheets if making 12 croissants. If making only 9 you don't have to worry about rotating pans. Continue to bake until deep golden brown, 8 to 12 minutes longer. Watch carefully so they do not burn.

The first few times I made croissants, I struggled not to burn them. I found that they browned within 10 or so minutes but was never quite sure if I should pull them out of the oven because I was concerned they weren't baked all the way through. To this day, I don't think I've ever kept croissants in the oven for more than 15 minutes or 20 at the most. If your croissants are browning too quickly, try covering them loosely with aluminum foil and continue baking.

And that's pretty much all there is to it for croissants! There is a note at the end of the recipe about freezing some of them prior to proofing and baking, which I usually do because, as much as I'd like to, I can't eat 22 croissants in two days. Sadly, I've always felt like there is a pretty fair difference in quality between the croissants baked immediately and those that are frozen, thawed, proofed, and baked. If you have success with the frozen ones, please share your secrets with me!




The recipe I outlined above and am sharing below is actually the first croissant recipe I ever made. It's adapted from a recipe created by America's Test Kitchen. I really appreciate how clearly they spell out the directions and really walk you through the recipe. Though I enjoy experimenting with croissant recipes from some of my other most trusted baking websites (Serious Eats, The Kitchn, King Arthur Flour), this is the one I always come back to - it feels familiar, comfortable. Hopefully it can be that for you as well.







Basic Croissants

Makes 22 (freeze some for later!) (or eat all 22 in the same afternoon!)
Adapted from America's Test Kitchen



Dough:

3 tablespoons unsalted butter

1 3/4 cups whole milk, cold

4 teaspoons instant or rapid-rise yeast 

4 1/4 cups (21 1/4 ounces) all-purpose flour ( King Arthur is recommended)

1/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces) sugar 

2 teaspoons kosher salt 



Butter Block:

12 oz (24 tablespoons) unsalted European-style butter, very cold



Egg Wash:

1 large egg 

1 teaspoon cold water

pinch of salt



Directions:



DOUGH:

1. Over low heat, melt the 3 tablespoons butter in a medium saucepan. Remove pan from heat and immediately stir in milk (the temperature should be lower than 90 degrees F ). 

2. Whisk in yeast and transfer milk mixture to bowl of a stand mixer. 

3. Add the flour, sugar, and salt  to the bowl with milk mixture. Using dough hook, knead on low speed until a cohesive dough forms, which should take about 2 to 3 minutes. 

4. Increase mixer speed to medium-low and knead for 1 more minute. 

5. Remove bowl from mixer and cover with plastic wrap. 

6. Let dough rest at room temperature 30 minutes.

7. Transfer dough to parchment paper–lined baking sheet

8. Pat the dough (using your fingertips) into 10 x 7-inch rectangle about 1 inch thick.

9. Wrap dough tightly with plastic and refrigerate for 2 hours.



BUTTER BLOCK: 

1. While the dough chills, fold a 24-inch length of parchment paper in half to make a 12-inch rectangle. Fold over the 3 open sides of the rectangle to form an 8-inch square with enclosed sides. Crease folds firmly. Set aside.

2. Place 24 tablespoons (12 oz) very cold butter directly on counter and beat with rolling pin for about 60 seconds (or so) until butter is just pliable but not warm. You can then fold butter on itself using a bench scraper and form it roughly into a 6 inch square.

3. Unfold parchment envelope you set aside earlier. Using bench scraper, transfer butter to center of the parchment paper, refolding at creases to enclose. 

4. Turn packet over, with flaps underneath, and using a rolling pin on top of the parchment paper, gently roll until butter fills the parchment square. Make sure you have an even thickness. 

5. Refrigerate butter packet at least 45 minutes.



LAMINATE: 

1. After the dough has been in the fridge for at least 2 hours (the original recipe calls for putting the dough in the freezer for 30 min as well, which I would say is optional), transfer dough to lightly floured counter and roll into 17 x 8-inch rectangle with the long side parallel to edge of counter. 

2. Unwrap butter packet and place the butter in center of dough. 

3. Fold both sides of dough over butter so they meet in center. Press seam together with fingertips. 

4. With rolling pin, press firmly on each open end of the dough and butter packet (top and bottom) to seal edges. 

5. Roll out lengthwise into a 24 x 8-inch rectangle. Fold into thirds like a business letter, so you get an 8-inch square. 

6. Turn dough 90 degrees counterclockwise. Roll the dough out lengthwise again into 24 x 8-inch rectangle and fold into thirds, again like a business letter. 

7. Place dough on a parchment paper (or cookie sheet), and wrap it tightly with plastic. 

8. Place dough in freezer for 30 minutes. 

9. After 30 minutes, transfer dough from freezer to a lightly floured counter, so that top flap opens on right. 

10. Roll out dough lengthwise into 24 x 8-inch rectangle and fold into thirds. 

11. Place dough on sheet, wrap tightly with plastic, and refrigerate for 2 hours or up to 24 hours, preferably overnight.


30 minutes before you are ready to begin shaping, throw the dough in the freezer. This will keep the dough from reaching room temperature as quickly during the shaping process.

SHAPE: 

1. After 30 minutes in the freezer, remove and transfer dough to a lightly floured counter. Roll into 18 x 16-inch rectangle with long side of rectangle parallel to edge of counter. Go all around the rectangle and cut off just the very edges.

2. Generously dust half of the dough with flour. Fold upper half of dough over lower floured half. 

3. Using ruler, mark dough at 3-inch intervals along bottom edge with bench scraper (you should have 5 marks). 

4. Move ruler to top edge of dough, measure in 1 1/2 inches from left, then use this mark to measure out 3-inch intervals (you should have 6 marks). 

5. Starting at lower left corner, use sharp pizza wheel, bench scraper, or knife to cut dough from mark to mark. You will have 12 triangles and 5 diamonds. Either discard scraps or place scraps next to each other in a small tart pan to rise.

6. Unfold diamonds and cut in half to make 10 triangles (you will have 22 equal-size triangles in total).

7. Position 1 triangle on counter. (Keep remaining triangles covered with plastic.) 

8. Cut 1/2-inch slit in center of short side of triangle. Grasp triangle by 2 corners on either side of slit and stretch gently, then stretch bottom point, again gently. Brush any extra flour off the dough.

9. Place triangle on counter so point is facing you. Fold down both sides of slit. Roll top of triangle partway toward point. Gently grasp point with 1 hand and stretch again. Resume rolling, tucking point underneath. 

10. Curve ends gently toward each other to create a crescent shape. Repeat with remaining triangles.

11. Place 9 shaped croissants on a parchment lined sheet (or 12 croissants on 2 parchment-lined sheets) at least 2 1/2 inches apart.

12. Lightly wrap with plastic. Let stand at room temperature (70 degrees F is ideal) until nearly doubled in size, 2 1/2 to 3 hours.

The rest of the shaped croissants can be refrigerated for up to 18 hours. Remove from refrigerator to rise and add at least 30 minutes to rising time. You can also freeze the rest of the shaped croissants (see make ahead note at the end of the recipe).

13. After croissants have been rising for about 2 1/2 hours (or until croissants have almost doubled), preheat oven to 400 and adjust oven rack to be in the middle if making only 9 croissants and using 1 sheet. If making 12 croissants and using 2 sheets, adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions.

14. In small bowl, whisk together egg, water, and a pinch of salt.

15. Brush croissants with egg wash. Place croissants in hot oven and reduce temperature to 375 degrees F. 

16.  Bake for 10 minutes, then switch and rotate baking sheets if making 12 croissants. If making only 9 you don't have to worry about rotating pans. Continue to bake until deep golden brown, 8 to 12 minutes longer. Watch carefully so they do not burn.

17. Transfer croissants to wire rack and cool about 15 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature. 



TO MAKE AHEAD: see step 12 above. 

1. Directly after shaping, place the croissants you wish to freeze on parchment-lined sheet 1 inch apart. 

2. Wrap with plastic and freeze until solid, about 2 hours. 

3. Transfer to zipper-lock bag and freeze for up to 2 months. 

4. Bake frozen croissants as directed from step 11, increasing rising time by to 2 hours, or as needed to double in size.

Warm the milk in a pan on the stove, or in 5-second intervals in the microwave.  Place the flour, warm milk, yeast mixture and oil in a bowl, and mix together.
You can use a stand mixer or mix the ingredients by hand with a spatula.
Be sure the milk doesn't come to a boil when you warm it. If it does, start over with new milk.Knead the dough.  If you're using a stand mixer, you can simply let it continue to do the work for you for a minute or two after the ingredients are combined.  If you're kneading by hand, punch out the dough 8 to 10 times.  It should feel smooth and elastic when you're done.Let the dough rise. Place the dough into a clean bowl dusted with flour.  The flour will make it easier to remove the dough from the bowl later. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a dish towel. Allow the dough to rise for one to two hours.  When it's doubled in size, you'll be ready for the next step.
You can snip an X into the top of the dough to help the dough rise a little more quickly.  Cut an X that's about 2 inches (5 cm) wide in the middle of the dough.
Place the dough in a warm area in your kitchen to help it rise faster.Press the dough. After the dough has doubled, gently remove it from the bowl and place it on a countertop lightly dusted with flour. Press the dough into an 8x12-inch rectangle (20x30 cm).  Try to keep the edges as straight as possible.  You can use your hands, or gently press down with a rolling pin.Turn the dough. Fold the dough into thirds, like a letter.  This is called ""turning.""  Fold up the bottom third of the dough so that it covers the middle third, then fold the top third down over the other two layers.Let the dough rise a second time. Cover the dough lightly with plastic wrap or a dish towel. Let it rise until it doubles in size again, which should take about an hour and a half. Put it in the refrigerator for the last half-hour, since it needs to be chilled for the next step.

Repeat the process, working from the bottom and then the top.  Turn the dough over, and place it seam side down in a lightly oiled  bowl.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a dish towel and let sit at room temperature for 1 hour.Line a quarter sheet pan with parchment paper.  Uncover the dough, run the bowl scraper around the sides and bottom of the bowl to release the dough, and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface, disturbing the structure as little as possible.  Gently but firmly pat the dough into a rectangle about 10 x 7 ½ inches, pressing any large gas bubbles to the edges and then out of the dough.  Transfer to the sheet pan, cover with plastic wrap, and freeze for 20 minutes.To encase the butter and roll the dough:  Lightly flour the work surface and a heavy rolling pin.  Turn the dough out onto the work surface and lightly dust the top with flour.  Roll the dough outward from the center, rotating it frequently and flipping and fluffing it from time to time, adding just enough flour to the work surface, dough, and/or pin to prevent sticking, until you have a 16 x 7 ½ x ½ inch thick rectangle.Lay the block of butter across the center of the dough.  Stretch and fold over the two longer sides so they meet in the center and pinch together to seal.  There should be no exposed butter at the top of the block, but you will see the butter on the sides.Using the rolling pin, press down firmly on the dough across the seam from one side to the other to expand the dough.  Turn the dough so a short end faces you.  Roll to expand the length of the dough, flipping, fluffing, and turning the dough over and adding flour only as needed, until you have a rectangle  about 22 x 9 inches and 3/8 inch thick.Fold the bottom third of the dough up as if you were folding a letter.  Fold the top third down to cover the bottom third.  Turn the block 90 degrees so the dough resembles a book, with the opening on the right.  You will continue this pattern with each roll, and keeping the opening on the right will help you remember how to position the dough.  You have completed your first turn; gently press a finger into a corner to mark it.  Return to the sheet pan, cover with plastic wrap, and freeze for 20 minutes or until the dough has stiffened but is not hard.Lightly dust the work surface with flour.  Place the dough on the work surface with the opening on the right.  It is important to work with the dough as quickly as possible, but not at the risk of exposing the butter.  Pressing on the dough will warm the butter; if it is too cold, it will shatter rather than spread as you roll it.  Expand the dough by pressing down firmly with the rolling pin, working up the length of the dough.  If the dough cracks at all along the edges, stop and let it warm slightly at room temperature. Then roll out the dough as you did before to a 22 x 9 x 3/8 inch thick rectangle and repeat the folding.  Turn the block 90 degrees, so the opening is on the right.  Gently press 2 fingers into a corner to mark the dough.  Return to the sheet pan, cover with plastic wrap, and freeze for 20 minutes or until the dough has stiffened but is not hard.Repeat all of the steps for turn 2 and mark the dough with 3 fingerprints.Line a sheet pan with parchment paper and lightly dust the work surface with flour.  Place the dough on the work surface with the opening on the right.It is especially critical at this stage that the dough remain cold; freeze as needed.  Lightly dust the top of the dough and roll it outward from the center, flipping, fluffing, and rotating the dough and turning it over, adding only enough flour to the work surface, dough, and/or pin as necessary to prevent sticking.  Roll the dough out to 24 x 9 inches.Cut the dough into 2 12x9 pieces and lay on the sheet pan with a piece of parchment in between each. Wrap with plastic wrap and either freeze until ready to use, or for 20 minutes if you're planning to shape the croissants right awaySpray two sheet pans with nonstick spray and line with parchment paper (or just use 1 sheet pan if only using half the batch of dough).Lightly flour the work surface.  Remove one piece of dough from the freezer and position it on the work surface with the short end towards you; transfer the second piece of dough (if using at this time) to the refrigerator.  Roll the dough out to a rectangle 19 x 9 inches.Turn the dough so that a long side is facing you and trim it to 18 inches long.  Trim the remaining sides only as needed for straight edges.Cut the dough in half, crosswise, so that you have two squares, about 9 x 9 inches wide.  Then cut each squash in half so that you end up with four rectangles.  Cut each rectangle diagonally so that you end up with 8 right triangles.Hold one triangle up by the base with one hand and, using your fingertips, gently pull the dough until it is stretched to about 12 inches.Put the dough on the work surface, with the base of the triangle close to you.  If using the almond filling (directions below,) spread a small amount on the widest part of the dough.Fold over the corners to the center of the base and roll the dough up from the wide end to the tip.  Put on a prepared sheet with the tail tucked under.  Press down slightly, flattening the croissant just enough so that it will not roll on the pan.  Repeat with the remaining 7 triangles of dough, spacing them evenly on the sheet pan.Remove the second piece of dough from the refrigerator, and, if necessary, let sit at room temperature until warmed enough to roll, then repeat to make 8 more croissants.  Cover pans loosely with plastic wrap and allow to proof for 2 hours. When a finger gently pressed into the edge holds the indent, they are done proofing.Combine all syrup ingredients in a small saucepan and simmer until sugar is dissolved. Turn heat off and steep for an hour.Strain solids out then syrup is ready to use.Using an electric mixer cream together the almond paste, butter, and egg whites. Add in the powdered sugar and mix until smooth.Preheat oven to 350F. When done proofing, brush croissants with egg white wash. If making almond croissants, also brush generously with the almond syrup and press slivered almonds into the top.Bake for 35-40 minutes, rotating the pans once halfway through baking and separating the croissants if they are touching, until the tops are a rich golden brown and no portions, particularly between the layers, look undercooked.  Set the pans on a rack and cool completely.",croissant

Homemade Croissants... ATK/Cook' s Illustrated version... Memories of Paris. Freshly baked croissants in bakeries everywhere. Some filled with chocolate, some plain... but all of them flaky with a buttery goodness. Though it's been a few years since visiting Paris, I've kept many a memory of the times my husband and I would have breakfast together, stopping at a local bakery and ordering a delicious breakfast treat to go along with a cup of espresso. It seemed croissants were always available in the early morning hours....and you could smell the butter in the air as you entered the bakery shop.



Croissants. I've always wanted to make croissants... but could it ever be doable... you know, to make at home? And I mean the real croissants. The ones that are airy, flaky and buttery.... with a delicate crisp shattering outside ""crust"". Not the somewhat flaky pie crust/crescent type... where the butter sort of combines with the flour and has no layers. Those are good too, ... but I wanted the croissants to be like those in Paris.



I have to admit I've tried making croissants before... quite a few years ago. And as much as I wanted them to have been a success back then, well... they really weren't. And truth be told, I tried making croissants a few more times after that... with different recipes... until I gave up. Somehow, I felt I would never be able to get the dough to bake up like a real croissant.... like those in Paris. So I stopped trying to bake the ""perfect"" croissant. Figured the home cook can't... just don't have the right laminating machine, the right oven, etc. But recently, I decided to try again... after all these years. And this time... from a recipe by the folks at Cook's Illustrated. 



I've always had great success with Cook's Illustrated/Cook's Country/America's Test Kitchen's recipes. Many of their recipes are personal favorites. So when I came across their croissant recipe video, I felt I could try making croissants again. I mean, they sure made it look simple!  But before trying out the recipe, I made sure to have the right ingredients....  which meant european-style butter(less water and a bit higher fat%) and King Arthur's flour(has a bit higher protein%).  I hardly ever buy european-style butter, but in this case, I was willing to buy it. I wanted my croissants to come out... without blaming myself that I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  The butter was the only new ingredient I had to buy... because for the past few years, I've been using King Arthur flour for all my baking... so the flour wasn't an issue. 



In any case, I basically followed their recipe without any changes of mine (well, except as noted in the last tip). The result was unbelievably amazing. You truly can make croissants at home! They were just what I had been wanting to make all these years... and I wouldn't change a thing about them. Even the butter was well worth the investment... you can actually taste the difference. And you know what?... the croissants weren't really that difficult to make. 



Ok, I have to admit it might not be an easy recipe... especially for a beginner. And I must mention, since trying out my very first croissant recipe years ago, I've had plenty of experience with laminated dough(or puff pastry).... so I didn't attempt this recipe without knowing the basics. Over the years, I've learned through trials and errors, that a laminated dough must be kept cold at all times... otherwise, the dough won't have those distinct layers.... you'll just get a buttery dough. And since croissants are similar to puff pastry, I wasn't going into something foreign. The only difference in making a croissant dough is that you add yeast and milk. 



This recipe is what a croissant is all about... I don't think I''ll  be trying another recipe. For me it was a winner, and will definitely be making again.  By the way, did you know the croissants were first invented in Austria?... at least that's what they say. Could have very well been. I wouldn't know. However, I do know the Austrians make amazing desserts... as do the French. But regardless who invented the croissant... this recipe is worth making. Just give yourself some time, don't rush and be as precise as possible... oh, and enjoy your hard work:). They're totally worth it. Hope you enjoy...            



Update: I much prefer to bake ALL the croissants when freshly made and freezing them baked... rather than freezing the unbaked rolled croissants and then defrosting to rise and bake later.... the wait is too long, and they never seem to rise as high as the original.     



Note: Though it looks like the longest of posts, the process isn't really that long... just lots of waiting in between folding, refrigerating and rising.




Tips: 



It really helps being precise... use a ruler to measure. Oh, and read the recipe/watch the video a couple of times to understand the process before proceeding.   
Keep your butter cold at all times... when folding dough, if you notice the butter getting soft, refrigerate/freeze dough until it firms up.
Work in a 70 deg F kitchen... ideally no hotter. A couple of degrees above won't matter much, but when the kitchen is too hot, the croissants will suffer. 
While folding and rolling, use a straight edge(I used the side of a large knife) to bring the dough to the proper measurements. 
Allow the  croissants to rise in a 68-72 deg F... ideally no colder nor much hotter. If it's too cold, the yeast will take much longer to activate... and if it's too hot, the butter in the dough will melt.  
While Cook's Illustrated/ATK does not say to lightly cover croissants with aluminum paper half way through baking, I find it essential to do this. This way you don't have croissants that are burned/overly browned.... and at the same time have the insides cooked through.

Dough:

3 tablespoons unsalted butter

1 3/4 cups whole milk 

4 teaspoons instant or rapid-rise yeast 

4 1/4 cups (21 1/4 ounces) all-purpose flour ( King Arthur is preferred, what I used)

1/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces) sugar 

2 teaspoons kosher salt 




Butter Block:

12 oz (24 tablespoons) unsalted European-style-butter, very cold (I used Plugra, recommended)




Egg Wash:

1 large egg 

1 teaspoon cold water

pinch of salt



Directions:




DOUGH:

1. Over low heat, melt the 3 tablespoons butter in a medium saucepan. Remove pan from heat and immediately stir in milk (the temperature should be lower than 90 degrees F ). 

2. Whisk in yeast and transfer milk mixture to bowl of a stand mixer. 

3.  Add the flour, sugar, and salt  to the bowl with milk mixture. Using dough hook, knead on low speed until a cohesive dough forms... which should take about 2 to 3 minutes. 

4. Increase mixer speed to medium-low and knead for 1 more minute. 

5. Remove bowl from mixer and cover with plastic wrap. 

6. Let dough rest at room temperature 30 minutes.

7. Transfer dough to parchment paper–lined baking sheet(I just placed a parchment paper on the counter and then placed the dough on the parchment paper)

8. Shape(using your fingertips) into 10 x 7-inch rectangle about 1 inch thick.

9. Wrap dough tightly with plastic and refrigerate for 2 hours.








BUTTER BLOCK: 

1. While the dough chills, fold a 24-inch length of parchment paper in half to make a 12-inch rectangle. 

2. Fold over the 3 open sides of the rectangle to form an 8-inch square with enclosed sides. 

3. Crease folds firmly. Set aside.





4. Cut and place 24 tablespoons (12 oz) very cold butter directly on counter (or leave on butter paper) and beat with rolling pin for about 60 seconds (or so) until butter is just pliable but not warm. You can  then fold butter on itself using bench scraper, but I didn't... I sort of cut a few pieces of butter and added them to the sides to make the corners. 

5. Beat butter into a rough 6-inch square... 

6. Unfold parchment envelope you set aside earlier. Using bench scraper(or butter paper), transfer butter to center of the parchment paper, refolding at creases to enclose. 

7. Turn packet over, with flaps underneath, and using a rolling pin on top of the parchment paper, gently roll until butter fills the parchment square. Make sure you have an even thickness. 

8. Refrigerate  butter packet at least 45 minutes.... or longer.






LAMINATE: 




Before making the laminate dough you will need to transfer the dough from the above DOUGH directions, step 8,...  and place in the freezer for 30 minutes.




1. After 30 minutes in the freezer, transfer dough to lightly floured counter and roll into 17 x 8-inch rectangle with the long side parallel to edge of counter. 

2. Unwrap butter packet and place the butter in center of dough. 

3. Fold both sides of dough over butter so they meet in center. Press seam together with fingertips. 

4. With rolling pin, press firmly on each open end of packet( top and bottom) to seal edges. 



5. Roll out lengthwise into a 24 x 8-inch rectangle. Fold into thirds like a business letter ... so you get an 8-inch square. 

6. Turn dough 90 degrees counterclockwise. Roll the dough out lengthwise again into 24 x 8-inch rectangle and fold into thirds.... like a business letter. 






7. Place dough on a parchment paper (or cookie sheet), and wrap it tightly with plastic. 

8. Return dough to freezer for 30 minutes. 



Repeat folding after 30 minute freezer time:

1. Transfer dough from freezer to a lightly floured counter ... so that top flap opens on right. 

2. Roll out dough lengthwise into 24 x 8-inch rectangle and fold into thirds. 

3. Place dough on sheet, wrap tightly with plastic, and refrigerate for 2 hours or up to 24 hours. I left mine overnight.




SHAPE:  




Before shaping you will need to remove the laminated dough from the fridge after it's been in the fridge for the 2-24 required hours.... and place in the freezer for 30 minutes.



1. After the dough has been in the freezer for 30 minutes, transfer it to a lightly floured counter and roll into 18 x 16-inch rectangle with long side of rectangle parallel to edge of counter. 

2. Fold upper half of dough over lower half. 

3. Using ruler, mark dough at 3-inch intervals along bottom edge with bench scraper (you should have 5 marks). 

4. Move ruler to top edge of dough, measure in 1 1/2 inches from left, then use this mark to measure out 3-inch intervals (you should have 6 marks). 

5. Starting at lower left corner, use sharp pizza wheel or knife to cut dough from mark to mark. You will have 12 triangles and 5 diamonds; discard scraps.... place scraps(next to each other) in a small tart pan to rise.

6. Unfold diamonds and cut into 10 triangles (making 22 equal-size triangles in total).

7. Position 1 triangle on counter. (Keep remaining triangles covered with plastic.) 

8. Cut 1/2-inch slit in center of short side of triangle. Grasp triangle by 2 corners on either side of slit and stretch gently, then stretch bottom point, again gently. 

9. Place triangle on counter so point is facing you. Fold down both sides of slit. Roll top of triangle partway toward point. Gently grasp point with 1 hand and stretch again. Resume rolling, tucking point underneath. 

10. Curve ends gently toward each other to create crescent. Repeat with remaining triangles.

11. Place 9 shaped croissants on a parchment lined sheet (or 12 croissants on 2 parchment-lined sheets)... at least 2 1/2 inches apart. 






12. Lightly wrap with plastic. Let stand at room temperature( 70 degrees F is ideal) until nearly doubled in size, 2 1/2 to 3 hours.

( The rest of the shaped croissants can be refrigerated for up to 18 hours. Remove from refrigerator to rise and add at least 30 minutes to rising time.... I personally haven't yet tried this. 

Or you can freeze the rest of the shaped croissants (what I ended up doing).... see Make Ahead Note at the bottom of this post. ) 






13. After croissants have been rising for about 2 1/2 hours(or until croissants have almost doubled)...



 adjust oven rack to be in the middle... if making only 9 croissants and using 1 sheet.
adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions... if making 12 croissants and using 2 sheets. 
 heat oven to 425 degrees F. 

14. In small bowl, whisk together egg, water, and pinch salt.



15. Brush croissants with egg wash. Place croissants in hot oven and reduce temperature to 400 degrees F. 

16.  Bake for 12 minutes, then switch and rotate baking sheets if making 12 croissants. If making only 9 you don't have to worry about rotating pans.

17. After about 12 minutes baking time, loosely cover croissants with aluminum paper and continue to bake until deep golden brown, 8 to 12 minutes longer. My total baking time was close to 20 minutes. Do watch so as not to burn. 

Note: Covering the croissants with aluminum paper was my idea to keep the croissants from not burning on the outside, and yet still cooking completely inside.... you can skip it if you like, but the croissants have a tendency to burn rather quickly .

18. Transfer croissants to wire rack and cool about 15 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature. 




TO MAKE AHEAD: see step 12 above. 

1. After shaping, place 10 croissants( or the remainder if you've baked only 9) 1 inch apart on parchment-lined sheet. 

2. Wrap with plastic and freeze until solid, about 2 hours. 

3. Transfer to zipper-lock bag and freeze for up to 2 months. 

4. Bake frozen croissants as directed from step 8, increasing rising time by to 2 hours, or as needed to double in size.

That is unless you are vegan. No croissants for those butter despisers, right? Because croissants need butter. So vegan croissants can’t be a thing.Actually are. I make them with margarine all the time. And look how they turn out! If you use the right kind of margarine (In Germany that is Alsan) you won’t even miss the butter.How to work with coconut oilYou can also make croissants with coconut oil. Atmittedly they will have weaker layers compared to croissants made with margarine. They might look a bit like a roll made from regular enriched dough. But even though they aren’t that perfect, they do taste great! (On the right side you can see a croissant made with margarine. The one on the left was made with coconut oil.Very sadly my first few batches of coconut oil based croissants ended up in the bin. These layered crescents are not for novice bakers anyway, but working with coconut oil makes them even harder to produce. That is, if you follow the instructions for regular croissants, which involve a lot of refrigerating. And that won’t work with coconut oil.Coconut oil is 100 % fat. It has no water and the saturated fats it contains make it turn into a solid block at low temperatures. And believe me, it will turn into that block faster than you can blink. Croissants usually have to be cooled a lot so that the yeast dough and the fat have the same texture. The same texture is necessary for easy rolling and folding. Nobody wants bumps or holes in their croissants. It will ruin them. But if  you store a coconut oil filled dough in the fridge that has to end in a disaster. You won’t be able to work with a rock hard piece of fat that is wrapped in a soft dough. You can’t roll it out properly. You will apply too much pressure and your dough will tear.But of course I didn’t give up until I had found the perfect method to make croissants. Which is a method I didn’t come up with. I have (and want) to thank the wonderful Lagusta for her amazing blog post on how to make great vegan croissants with coconut oil. And that blog post has been out there forever! I should probably use a search engine once in a while.Tips and tricks to make vegan croissants with coconut oilThe trick to the ultimate vegan croissant made with coconut oil is not to chill your oil. Instead you need to whip it until it is light and fluffy. Also between rolling and folding you should not refrigerate your dough. Keep it at room temperature and just try to work fast. But not too fast. Use a rolling pin and roll gently. Don’t press and do let the dough rest for a couple of minutes if rolling it out gets too difficult. The gluten will relax and then it’s easier to roll again.Another thing I should probably warn you about is that even though this is one of these handy “only six ingredient” recipes, it is not one of the “under 30 minute” wonders. First of all croissants are bread. And bread needs time. Period. You can always go with shortcuts of course, but most of the time you have to compromise the flavour for your time savings. For a flavourful croissant it is necessary to start a day in advance and prepare your dough. Make sure to use as little yeast as possible. That will guarantee a slow rise and it adds more flavour.In my opinion, a croissant with a strong yeast taste is not a good croissant. And if you use a whole package of some miraculous quick rise yeast, your croissant are probably going to taste awful. I  think the best yeast to go with here is fresh yeast. In Germany it is available in tiny 42 grams blocks in every supermarket. But since I have no idea how available fresh yeast is in other countries, I will include a variation with instant yeast, too.Flour types and yeastFor both versions (margarine and coconut oil) we will start with a basic dough that you have to prepare the night before you want to bake your croissants. A long rest and slow rise in the fridge will help the dough develop flavour.Although you can use all-purpose flour with no problem, I’ve found that white spelt flour (German type 630) works better with the coconut oil version. It is a bit stretchier than all purpose flour. That means the croissant dough is easier to roll out. But as I said, all-purpose flour will be fine, if you don’t have white spelt on hand.Also, as always I encourage you to experiment! My recipe is only a suggestion and maybe you will get better results with the coconut oil version, if you leave out the flour for the filling or choose a sturdier flour (like all-purpose or bread flour). You never know. I am not a trained chef and am figuring out these things out as I go. If you experiment with this recipe (or have experimented with croissants), please let me know and leave a comment.When your dough has chilled over night, prepare the filling for either the margarine or the coconut oil based version in the following ways:  Print  PinVegan CroissantsMake your own vegan croissants at home.

(Yeah, sometimes my English is so bad so I have to use the help of drawings. I admit I have a hard time explaining this, but there are also lots of great online tutorials on how to make laminated dough and croissants) The following picture is meant for the coconut oil version, but you should get the picture. Ignore the measurements and don’t forget to remove the remaining cling film before you start folding:On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out until it’s about 30 x 40 cm.Take the margarine out of the fridge and peel off the top layer of cling film.Turn around and place on top of the dough so that side that still has cling film on is on top now. The following picture will show you how exactly to position your margarine (or the coconut oil). Make sure all the edges are sealed well. If the fat spills out, that’s not good. Roll out your dough carefully until it has doubled in size.If this gets too hard, you’ve got to let the dough relax for a couple of minutes and then resume rolling. Make sure not to press too much.Also, try to roll only in one direction.Roll into a rectangle that is about 1 cm thick and about 40 x 20 cm long.Fold your dough into thirds like a business letter by folding the bottom third over to the middle and then placing the top third over it.Cover with cling film and refrigerate for 20 minutes. Now turn the dough 90 degrees and roll into a rectangle again by rolling in one direction only. (That means you place the dough with the short side facing to you and then you roll from bottom to top.) Your rectangle should measure about 40 x 20 cm.You need to repeat this  process four times. Between each fold, refrigerate the dough for 20 minutes.Now that you’ve done that, roll the dough out one last time. The measurements I am giving here are only an approximate, because it all depends on how big you want your croissants to be.My dough was a square about 35 x 35 cm long. From that I cut the dough like this:Roll the croissants out until they have about doubled their length and look like this:Roll the croissants up and shape them into crescents. Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, cover with a damp kitchen towel and let them enough time to rise.I let mine rest for about 2 1/2 hours at room temperature (about 22°C)Preheat the oven to 200°C and bake the croissants for about 20 minutes, or until golden brown.For the coconut based version,Follow all the steps except for the handling of the fat and the refrigerating.For the filling, place coconut oil, flour, and salt in a mixer and whip until fluffy. make sure there are no lumps left.Instead of rolling out the fat between cling film, you have to spread it on the dough.Roll the dough into a square 30 x 30 cm. make sure the dough is sealed well, turn over and start rolling into a rectangle.Place the fat mixture on top and spread it into a 15 x 15 cm diamond and then fold the dough over to create and envelope. Make sure the dough is sealed well, turn over and start rolling into a rectangle.Roll out the dough even more carefully and do not refrigerate between the turns. Simply leave the dough on the counter for a couple of minutes to relax.If the dough gets to warm, you can roll it out on a refrigerated plastic bord that you’ve kept in the fridge.NotesIf you want shiny croissants, prepare a vegan egg wash and brush the croissants twice: the first time right before you place them in the oven and the second time about five minutes before taking them out. For the egg wash just combine 3 tablespoons of soy milk with three tablespoons of agave nectar and 1 tablespoon of cornstarch. If you want fresh croissants all week long, you don’t have to bake these immediately. You can let them rise and then place them in the freezer until they are frozen. Transfer to airtight containers and bring back to room temperature right before you are ready to bake them.As I said, this is not a beginner’s recipe and you might need some practice. I’ve done this about five to six times before I got it right. If your dough gets holes and the fat starts to spill out, try to limit the damage by sprinkling some flour over it. That is not ideal and the leaking of fat shouldn’t happen. But it does, especially with coconut oil.That’s it.

Croissants usually have to be cooled a lot so that the yeast dough and the fat have the same texture. The same texture is necessary for easy rolling and folding. Nobody wants bumps or holes in their croissants. It will ruin them. But if  you store a coconut oil filled dough in the fridge that has to end in a disaster. You won’t be able to work with a rock hard piece of fat that is wrapped in a soft dough. You can’t roll it out properly. You will apply too much pressure and your dough will tear.But of course I didn’t give up until I had found the perfect method to make croissants. Which is a method I didn’t come up with. I have (and want) to thank the wonderful Lagusta for her amazing blog post on how to make great vegan croissants with coconut oil. And that blog post has been out there forever! I should probably use a search engine once in a while.Tips and tricks to make vegan croissants with coconut oilThe trick to the ultimate vegan croissant made with coconut oil is not to chill your oil. Instead you need to whip it until it is light and fluffy. Also between rolling and folding you should not refrigerate your dough. Keep it at room temperature and just try to work fast. But not too fast. Use a rolling pin and roll gently. Don’t press and do let the dough rest for a couple of minutes if rolling it out gets too difficult. The gluten will relax and then it’s easier to roll again.Another thing I should probably warn you about is that even though this is one of these handy “only six ingredient” recipes, it is not one of the “under 30 minute” wonders. First of all croissants are bread. And bread needs time. Period. You can always go with shortcuts of course, but most of the time you have to compromise the flavour for your time savings. For a flavourful croissant it is necessary to start a day in advance and prepare your dough. Make sure to use as little yeast as possible. That will guarantee a slow rise and it adds more flavour.In my opinion, a croissant with a strong yeast taste is not a good croissant. And if you use a whole package of some miraculous quick rise yeast, your croissant are probably going to taste awful. I  think the best yeast to go with here is fresh yeast. In Germany it is available in tiny 42 grams blocks in every supermarket. But since I have no idea how available fresh yeast is in other countries, I will include a variation with instant yeast, too.Flour types and yeastFor both versions (margarine and coconut oil) we will start with a basic dough that you have to prepare the night before you want to bake your croissants. A long rest and slow rise in the fridge will help the dough develop flavour.Although you can use all-purpose flour with no problem, I’ve found that white spelt flour (German type 630) works better with the coconut oil version. It is a bit stretchier than all purpose flour. That means the croissant dough is easier to roll out. But as I said, all-purpose flour will be fine, if you don’t have white spelt on hand.Also, as always I encourage you to experiment! My recipe is only a suggestion and maybe you will get better results with the coconut oil version, if you leave out the flour for the filling or choose a sturdier flour (like all-purpose or bread flour). You never know. I am not a trained chef and am figuring out these things out as I go. If you experiment with this recipe (or have experimented with croissants), please let me know and leave a comment.When your dough has chilled over night, prepare the filling for either the margarine or the coconut oil based version in the following ways:  Print  PinVegan CroissantsMake your own vegan croissants at home.

(Yeah, sometimes my English is so bad so I have to use the help of drawings. I admit I have a hard time explaining this, but there are also lots of great online tutorials on how to make laminated dough and croissants) The following picture is meant for the coconut oil version, but you should get the picture. Ignore the measurements and don’t forget to remove the remaining cling film before you start folding:On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out until it’s about 30 x 40 cm.Take the margarine out of the fridge and peel off the top layer of cling film.Turn around and place on top of the dough so that side that still has cling film on is on top now. The following picture will show you how exactly to position your margarine (or the coconut oil). Make sure all the edges are sealed well. If the fat spills out, that’s not good. Roll out your dough carefully until it has doubled in size.If this gets too hard, you’ve got to let the dough relax for a couple of minutes and then resume rolling. Make sure not to press too much.Also, try to roll only in one direction.Roll into a rectangle that is about 1 cm thick and about 40 x 20 cm long.Fold your dough into thirds like a business letter by folding the bottom third over to the middle and then placing the top third over it.Cover with cling film and refrigerate for 20 minutes. Now turn the dough 90 degrees and roll into a rectangle again by rolling in one direction only. (That means you place the dough with the short side facing to you and then you roll from bottom to top.) Your rectangle should measure about 40 x 20 cm.You need to repeat this  process four times. Between each fold, refrigerate the dough for 20 minutes.Now that you’ve done that, roll the dough out one last time. The measurements I am giving here are only an approximate, because it all depends on how big you want your croissants to be.My dough was a square about 35 x 35 cm long. From that I cut the dough like this:Roll the croissants out until they have about doubled their length and look like this:Roll the croissants up and shape them into crescents. Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, cover with a damp kitchen towel and let them enough time to rise.I let mine rest for about 2 1/2 hours at room temperature (about 22°C)Preheat the oven to 200°C and bake the croissants for about 20 minutes, or until golden brown.For the coconut based version,Follow all the steps except for the handling of the fat and the refrigerating.For the filling, place coconut oil, flour, and salt in a mixer and whip until fluffy. make sure there are no lumps left.Instead of rolling out the fat between cling film, you have to spread it on the dough.Roll the dough into a square 30 x 30 cm. make sure the dough is sealed well, turn over and start rolling into a rectangle.Place the fat mixture on top and spread it into a 15 x 15 cm diamond and then fold the dough over to create and envelope. Make sure the dough is sealed well, turn over and start rolling into a rectangle.Roll out the dough even more carefully and do not refrigerate between the turns. Simply leave the dough on the counter for a couple of minutes to relax.If the dough gets to warm, you can roll it out on a refrigerated plastic bord that you’ve kept in the fridge.NotesIf you want shiny croissants, prepare a vegan egg wash and brush the croissants twice: the first time right before you place them in the oven and the second time about five minutes before taking them out. For the egg wash just combine 3 tablespoons of soy milk with three tablespoons of agave nectar and 1 tablespoon of cornstarch. If you want fresh croissants all week long, you don’t have to bake these immediately. You can let them rise and then place them in the freezer until they are frozen. Transfer to airtight containers and bring back to room temperature right before you are ready to bake them.As I said, this is not a beginner’s recipe and you might need some practice. I’ve done this about five to six times before I got it right. If your dough gets holes and the fat starts to spill out, try to limit the damage by sprinkling some flour over it. That is not ideal and the leaking of fat shouldn’t happen. But it does, especially with coconut oil.That’s it. I hope you enjoy!MerkenMerkenMerkenMerkenSharing is caring!ShareTweetPin",croissant

They can be served alone for breakfast, or they can be topped with sweet ingredients for a dessert, or with savory flavors for a meal.As delicious as croissants are, they do go stale within three days, and you really don’t want to be left with a batch of wasted, stale croissants.If you have baked a fresh batch, or if you found a great deal on croissants at your local bakery, can you freeze them? It is completely possible to freeze croissants and to achieve the same flaky, buttery taste that fresh croissants have. You can freeze croissants you have baked at home or bought from the store. You can also choose to freeze croissant dough, as long as it has been shaped and flash-frozen first. Make sure to follow the proper handling and storage instructions when freezing croissants, as this will ensure that they will still taste wonderful and have the same delicate texture once they have been frozen, thawed and reheated.In order to maintain the great taste and texture of croissants, you need to ensure you freeze them, store them, and reheat them properly. Here is a guide on exactly how to do that!How To Freeze CroissantsCroissants need to be completely cooled before you freeze them. Once out the oven, remove the croissants from the baking pan and allow them to cool on a cooling rack (I use this one from Amazon and it’s perfect).The cooling rack allows air to circulate around on all sides, cooling the croissant down quicker.Once cooled, you should wrap each croissant lightly in clear plastic wrap. Make sure it is suitable to be put into the freezer.Wrap each croissant several times to ensure it has an airtight seal. If the plastic wrap does not stick to itself, use some freezer tape to secure it down.Or, you can use some reusable food wraps. I personally use this set organic beeswax set from Etee and they are perfect for this.When all the croissants have been wrapped, place them all into a large freezer bag, leaving around 2 inches of headroom at the top of the freezer bag.Try to squeeze out as much air as possible before sealing the bag shut. You might need to use multiple freezer bags depending on how many croissants you are freezing, just make sure that you do not overfill the bags, and that each croissant is wrapped tightly. Also, make sure you have high-quality double-sealed zipper bags like these.Label the plastic freezer bags with the date of freezing so you know when they should be used by.Place the bag of croissants against the freezer wall to rapid freeze, and then move them to the middle of the freezer after 24 hours once they have frozen throughout. Quick Tips For Freezing CroissantsMaximize the shelf life of croissants by covering them with plastic wrap or aluminum foil to prevent them from drying out.Freshly baked croissants will last up to 2 days when kept at normal room temperature.Stored properly, croissants will last up to 1 week in the fridge.Wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and stored in a plastic bag, croissants can be kept in the freezer for up to a year but should be consumed within 2 months for the best quality and taste.Can You Freeze Croissants Before Baking?You can either freeze croissants before or after baking. If you want to freeze croissants before baking, you should shape them first and place them on a baking sheet.Place the baking sheet into the freezer and allow each to freeze completely. Once they have frozen, you can place them into a freezer bag, label them, and then place the freezer bag into the freezer.When it is time to bake them, let them thaw overnight in the freezer, egg wash them and place them in the oven to bake. There should be no real difference between the freshness and texture when you bake them from frozen, and they should still be buttery and flaky, just like they would be fresh.If you want to make croissants at home, I highly recommend checking out this video by Joshua Weissman on YouTube. He recommends investing in this food scale (if you don’t have one) before getting started. Can You Refrigerate Croissants?If you only want to keep the croissants for a few days, and do not want to leave them at room temperature or freeze them, you can keep the croissants in the fridge.Allow the croissants to cool down first, and then wrap them in plastic wrap or in aluminum foil, similar to how you would do so if you were freezing them.Place the wrapped croissants in the innermost section of the fridge, as this is where the temperature remains the most consistent.They should be eaten within a week when kept in the fridge.How To Thaw and Reheat CroissantsWhen it comes time to enjoy your frozen croissants, you need to follow a few steps to ensure that they taste as good as possible and that you do not expose them to any bacteria during the thawing process (especially croissants which have not been baked yet). To thaw the croissants, you should remove them from the freezer and allow them to sit in the fridge overnight. This allows the croissants to thaw at a safe temperature, and although it does take a bit longer, it is the best way to thaw the croissants before baking.Place the croissants in the oven until heated throughout.You can also choose to reheat the croissants from frozen. You will have to adjust the reheating time to allow for the croissants to defrost and reheat while in the oven.Once the croissants have been reheated once, they should be eaten or discarded. You cannot reheat croissants a second time, as they will become stale, and there is a greater chance that they might spoil due to frequently changing temperatures.Just as you should not reheat the croissants, you should not refreeze them. The delicate flaky texture of a croissant will be ruined if you freeze it a second time, so it really just is not worth it.The Shelf Life Of CroissantsKnowing the shelf life of croissants is the best way to ensure you use them up before they go stale or bad. Left at room temperature, croissants should not be stored for longer than two days. There is a good chance of them going stale by the second day, and if you live in a warmer climate, there is a chance that the croissants can spoil after this as well.Kept in the refrigerator, croissants can stay fresh for up to a week. You will need to ensure they are kept in the right conditions, as they will last longer if kept protected in the fridge.When frozen, croissants can be kept in the freezer for up to one year. However, the quality of the croissants starts to decrease after 2 months, so it is best to consume them within this time frame. They will be safe to eat after this, but the quality, flakiness, and taste will not be great.The timelines listed above are all dependent on proper handling and storage. If the proper storage guidelines are not followed, the croissants will turn stale and possibly spoil before they are meant to.How To Tell If Croissants Have SpoiledThe first sign that you should get rid of your croissants is if they have gone stale. Stale croissants are not great to eat, and you should rather bake up or buy a new batch.To tell if croissants have gone off, you can look for any signs of mold. If there is any mold apparent, throw the croissants away.You can also smell the croissants, if there is a hint of an off-smell, they should be thrown away. The last option is to taste the croissant, you will be able to tell straight away whether or not it is off by having a taste.Related QuestionsCan you freeze croissant dough?You can freeze croissant dough successfully if you do not feel like baking them straight away. You should shape the dough before freezing, so it will be easier to work with when the time comes to bake them from frozen.How many layers should a croissant have?While you really don’t need to follow this exactly when making croissants at home, as it would be really difficult, croissants traditionally have three tri-folds that are perfect.This will give 81 layers that rise evenly as the croissant is baked, which gives it the delicate volume and flakes which croissants are so well-loved for.What is good to serve with a croissant?The beauty of croissants is that you can pair them with almost anything. Sweet options include chocolate, honey, maple syrup, and fresh fruit with whipped cream.For a more savory taste, you can have ham, egg, cheese, brie, bacon, caramelized onion, pickles, pretty much any savory item you could want.Should croissants be heated?Croissants are best served warm.

The dreaded croissant.

Making croissants can be scary. It can seem to be ridiculously hard. The first time I looked at a recipe and saw how long it was I FREAKED OUT. Said no way, I’m not making croissants, they take forever! Well they do take forever, but then one week when I knew I would have some time, I just relaxed and made them step by step.

Croissants aren’t that difficult necessarily. Just a long and physical process.The chilling time for the pastry is actually much longer than the time spent actually making and rolling it. The hardest part is probably laminating the dough, rolling it out and folding it so many times. My arms usually hurt the next day. But if you’re about to eat all those freshly baked croissants, a bit of exercise won’t kill you.

So don’t be afraid! I have taken lots and lots of photos of each process to make it simple. And you haven’t tried croissants until you have had one fresh out of the oven, buttery, warm and flaky. They are beyond delicious. At the time of writing, my croissant dough is resting in the fridge, in the middle of the laminating process. I can’t wait to eat one!

CROISSANTS
Adapted from Bourke Street Bakery, which is a brilliant book.
You can make these croissants over two or three days, depending on whether you want to rush or take more time.
You will need to make a ferment before making your actual dough. A ferment is a small amount of dough that rests overnight before being added into your actual dough. It is basically a starter, and helps the dough develop.
The Ferment
Make this the day before you want to make your croissants.
100g plain flour (3 1/2 oz)
55ml milk (1 3/4 fl oz)
5g brown sugar (1 tsp)
2 1/2g salt (1/2 tsp)
5g (1/8 oz) fresh yeast
20g unsalted butter, softened (3/4 oz)
Put all of the ingredients into the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Process on a low speed for 3-5 minutes, until you have a smooth, elastic dough that doesn’t break when stretched gently. You may need to help it out by hand as there isn’t much dough for the hook to grab onto. 
If you want to do it by hand, squeeze all the ingredients together until they begin to resemble a crumbly dough. Turn it out onto a clean surface and knead for about 10 minutes, until a smooth, elastic dough forms.
Form the dough into a ball and leave at room temperature for 2 hours. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight, or for up to 3 days.
The Croissants
Make sure all your ingredients for your croissants are chilled before making your dough.
935g plain flour (2 lb 1 oz)
550ml milk (19 fl oz)
60g brown sugar (1/3 cup)
15g salt (3 tsp)
35g fresh yeast (1 1/4 oz)
500g unsalted butter, extra for laminating (1 lb 2 oz)
If using an electric mixer, put the flour, milk, sugar, salt, yeast and ferment in the bowl of a mixer fitted with a dough hook. Process on a low speed for 3-4 minutes, then increase the speed to high and mix for a further 2 minutes. My mixture failed me here, couldn’t handle the large amount of dough. If you need to, take it out and finish kneading by hand.

If you want to make the whole thing by hand, put all the ingredients into a bowl and squeeze together until the mixture resembles a crumbly dough. Turn it out onto a clean surface and knead for about 10-15 minutes, until smooth and elastic.

Gather the dough into a ball, put it into a plastic bag and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight (this is where you can take the process onto a third day).
When you are ready to laminate (roll and fold) the dough, remove the extra 500g of butter from the fridge. It should be cold but malleable. Put the butter between two sheets of baking paper and use a rolling pin to gently pound the butter into a 20cm (8 inch) flat square about 1cm (1/2 inch) thick.

Using a lightly floured (or silicone) rolling pin (preferably with ball bearings unless you want to work your arms off), roll the dough out into a 20 x 40 cm (8 x 16 inch) rectangle.

Place the butter square in the center of the dough.

Fold the two sides of pastry over the top of the butter, squeezing any seams together to completely enclose the butter. The butter being in between all the layers of pastry is what is going to give your croissants that deliciously flaky texture.

Carefully roll the dough into a rectangle about 20 x 90 cm (8 x 35 inches). Fold one end of the rectangle in by one third, then fold the other long end over the top so the dough is now 20 x 30 cm (8 x 12 inches).


Put the dough into a plastic bag or cover with plastic wrap, place it on a tray and refrigerate for 20 minutes (this allows the gluten to relax). Repeat this folding and resting process (called turns) two more times.
Once the dough has had its final 20 minute rest in the fridge, it is ready to be shaped into croissants.
Take the dough out of the fridge and roll it into a 25 x 120cm (10 x 35 inch) rectangle. This may take quite a lot of energy as the dough will tend to spring back to its original size and resist being rolled out. If this happens, fold up the dough and rest it in the fridge for a few minutes before rolling again. Use a light dusting of flour to patch up any areas where there may be holes or butter poking out while you roll.
Get out a ruler. Along the bottom long side of your rectangle, use a knife to make a small cut every 9cm (4 inches). Accross the top long side of your rectangle, first make a small incision at 4.5cm (2 inches) and then at every 9cm (4 inches) after that, so that the top incisions are directly in the middle of the ones accross the bottom.

Line your ruler up between the first bottom incision and the first top incision. Use a knife to cut along the line.

Then rule from that same top incision to the next bottom incision and cut along that line. You will now have a cut out triangle.

Keep cutting the dough in the same manner until you have around 24 triangles.

Stack the triangles on a tray lined with baking paper, cover lightly with a clean tea towel and put in the fridge to rest for about 10 minutes.
Remove from the fridge and working one triangle at a time, make a small incision at the base of each one.

Stretch the two sides of the cut outwards and begin to roll up towards the pointy end.


Roll tightly, stretching out the tip as you get closer to it.



Press the tip into the croissant to secure, and place them tip side-down back onto the tray lined with baking paper. Repeat with remaining triangles, leaving well-spaced intervals between them on the trays.

Cover loosely with a clean, damp tea towel. Set aside in a warm room to proof (rise) for 1 1/2 – 2 hours. They should almost double in size and be quite puffy.

When almost ready to bake, preheat the oven to 240 C and prepare your egg wash.
The Egg Wash
1 egg
100ml milk (3 1/2 fl oz)
pinch salt
Whisk all the ingredients together in a small bowl until well combined.
Brush the egg wash lightly over the top of your croissants.

Place the trays into the oven and reduce the temperature to 190 C. Bake for 15-20 minutes until they are a deep, golden colour. Cool slightly on trays before serving. Makes 24 croissants.

Buttery, flaky, layered, soft, warm goodness.

Mini croissants and pain au chocolat.
Every Monday, we head downtown to participate in a free, non-competitive, evening walk/run, and, one Monday a month, we help out by staffing the check-in tables. When we volunteer, we like to bring little treats. Nothing too big, just a little bite that says to the other volunteers, thanks for helping. This past Monday, we decided to bring croissants. Made from scratch, of course, but not full-size croissants. We thought we’d try to make them bite-sized.

As with Tuesday’s post, this recipe and the techniques used come from Bouchon Bakery, by Thomas Keller and Sebastian Rouxel. And, if you’ve made croissants before, you’ll know that they’re involved and take awhile. Not a huge amount of your time, but a lot of time while the dough chills between rolling and folding. In that way, making croissants is very similar to making Puff Pastry. But, if you’re looking for a weekend baking project, these croissants may be the perfect thing for a Sunday afternoon treat. Let’s scratch ’em up!

IngredientsFor the Poolish, either75 g scant 1/3 cup water, room temperature75 g 1/2 cup flour50 g 1/4 cup sourdough starteror100 g scant half cup water, room temperature100 g 2/3 cup flourPinch dried yeastFor the butter block330 g 2 sticks + 14 Tbs European-style unsalted butter, coldFor the dough500 g 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour75 g 1/3 cup sugar10 g 1 Tbs instant yeast3 g 1/2 tsp diastatic malt powder200 g 3/4 cup + 1 Tbs water, room temperature100 g 14 Tbs unsalted butter, room temperature15 g 1 Tbs kosher saltFor the egg wash1 large egg1 tsp ice waterFor pain au chocolat1/4-1/2 cup high quality chocolate chips
InstructionsDay 1 -- Make the poolishIn a medium bowl, mix together flour, water, and starter (or yeast) until it resembles a batter. Loosely cover and let sit 12 to 15 hours.Day 2 -- Make and laminate doughPlace the 330 g of butter between between two sheets of baking parchment. Using a rolling pin, pound from side to side and shape into a block about 6 1/2 x 7 1/2 inches. Wrap tightly in parchment and refrigerate.In the bowl of a stand mixer, fitted with the dough hook, mix together flour, sugar, yeast, and malt powder for about 15 seconds.Pour about half the water around the poolish to free it from the bowl and add to the flour mixture. Add the butter and half the remaining water. Mix on low for 2 minutes. If the dough looks dry, add some reserved water until a dough forms. Scrape the bottom of the bowl to ensure that the flour is incorporated.Sprinkle salt on dough and mix on low for 20 minutes. Remove dough and form into a ball. Lightly oil mixing bowl and return dough to bowl, seam side down. Cover and let rise for 1 hour.Carefully remove dough to a work surface and pat and press to form a rectangle of dough about 10 x 7 1/2 inches. Line a baking sheet with baking parchment, and place dough in the center. Wrap with plastic and freeze for 20 minutes.Transfer dough to a lightly-floured work surface and roll out to a rectangle 16 x 7 1/2 inches. Place butter block in the center, and fold the long edges of dough over the butter, pinching to seal.For turn 1: Roll dough and butter out to form a 22 x 9 inch rectangle. Fold up bottom third, then fold down top third as if folding a letter. Place on parchment-lined sheet and wrap in plastic, then freeze for 20 minutes.For turn 2: With the seam of dough to your right, roll dough and butter out to form a 22 x 9 inch rectangle, lightly dusting with flour as needed. Fold up bottom third, then fold down top third as if folding a letter. Place on parchment-lined sheet and wrap in plastic, then freeze for 20 minutes.For turn 3: Do the same as turn 2, taking care to not let the butter break through the dough layer. Wrap and freeze for 20 minutes.Roll dough out to form a rectangle about 24 by 9 inches, lightly dusting with flour as necessary. Cut in half to form two 12 x 9 inch rectangles. Place one on the parchment-lined sheet. Place a sheet of parchment over the dough, then place the second piece of dough on top. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate overnight.Day 3 -- Shaping and bakingRemove one piece of dough and place it on a lightly-floured work surface. Roll out to about 19 inches long. Trim off the ragged edges, then cut the dough in half lengthwise to make two long rectangles.Line two baking sheets with parchment or silicone baking mats.For croissants, cut one length of dough into six rectangles, each about 3 x 4 1/2 inches. Cut each of the rectangles in half diagonally to form triangles. Working with one triangle at a time, stretch or roll out to a length of about 6 inches. With the long point away from you, fold in the bottom two corners of the triangle, then roll tightly into a traditional croissant shape. Place on baking sheet with the point on the bottom, pressing down lightly so the croissant will not roll.For pain au chocolat. Cut the long rectangle into about 9 rectangles, each 2 x 4 1/2 inches. Cut each rectangle in half to form a rectangle about 2 by 2 1/4 inches. Working with a piece at a time, stretch or roll to form a rectangle about 2 x 4 inches. Place 6 chocolate chips in the center, then fold the dough over from the bottom and the top, like folding a letter, and place on the baking sheet with the double layer on the bottom. Press down lightly to prevent unrolling.Apply egg wash. In a small, bowl, whisk together egg and ice water and brush over the tops of the corissants.Cover with cardboard boxes or plastic tubs and let proof for 2 hours.Preheat oven to 350°F. Bake for approximately 35 minutes, or until nicely browned with no unbaked spots remaining.You can either shape and bake the remaining dough or it can be wrapped tightly and frozen for up to a month.

Ingredient discussion:
Yes, ideally you should go out and buy a European-style butter. We didn’t, and we wonder if that’s why we only gave this (spoiler alert) recipe four stars. Everything we’ve read says the Plugra brand is the best choice. Now, when we went to the cupboard for the diastatic malt powder, it turns out that we didn’t have any. Did this happen to you, too? Well, it’s available on line, but we also know that King Arthur Bread flour has malted barley as an ingredient, which we think serves the same purpose, so we used 200 grams of bread flour and 300 grams of all-purpose. Hindsight being 20-20, we think that the bread flour had too much gluten and made the dough harder to roll out.
Procedure in detail:
Day 1 (the easy day):
Letting the poolish sit overnight will improve the flavor of the dough, plus it will jump-start the yeast!
Make poolish. Making the poolish the night before allows flavors to develop. We already have a sourdough starter from baking bread that has a lot of flavors, so we used some of that in place of instant yeast, but you can use instant yeast if that’s what you have. Basically, just stir the poolish ingredients –the water should be room temperature — together in a non-reactive bowl until the mixture resembles pancake batter. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let sit out — yep, right on the kitchen counter — overnight.

Day 2 (the busy day):
Pound the butter into a rectangle with your rolling pin.
Shape butter. Place the 330 g of butter between 2 pieces of baking parchment and pound from side to side and front to back with a rolling pin, until you have a block of butter about 6 1/2 x 7 1/2 inches in size. Wrap tightly in the parchment and refrigerate until needed.

Use about half the water to loosen the poolish from the bowl.
Make dough. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the flour, sugar, yeast, diastatic malt powder, and give it a few swirls of mixing. Pour half the 200 grams of water around the edge of the poolish and add the poolish to the flour. Add the 100 g of butter and half the remaining water, leaving about 50g (a little less than 1/4 cup). Mix on low for 2 minutes until all the flour is incorporated. If the dough seems dry, add a little more water.

Add the poolish to the flour mixture along with the butter. Mix a few minutes.

Sprinkle the salt on top, then mix on low for 20 minutes. Yep, two-zero.
Add salt. Sprinkle the salt over the top of the dough and mix. And mix. And mix. Mix for 20 minutes. We know that seems like a long time, and we agree; however, the original recipe doesn’t, so 20 minutes, it is.

After mixing, shape into a ball and place back in the oiled mixing bowl to rise.
Shape and rest. Place the dough on a work surface and shape into a ball. Meanwhile, lightly oil the mixer bowl with a neutral-flavored oil. Place the dough in the bowl, seam side down, and cover. Let rest and rise for an hour.

Press out to a rectangle, then wrap and freeze so the dough will have the same consistency as the butter.
Shape and freeze. Place the dough  on a lightly-floured work surface and pat and press down to form a rectangle about 10 x 7 1/2 inches in size. Line a baking sheet with parchment and place the dough in the center. Wrap in plastic and freeze for 20 minutes. Yep, set the timer so you don’t forget.

Place the butter block in the center and seal it in.
Encase butter. Now, we’re about to get into the real part of making croissant dough. Remove the dough from the freezer and place on a lightly-floured work surface. Use the rolling pin to roll the dough out to a rectangle about 16 x 7 1/2 inches. It seems to be easiest to place one of the short sides nearest you and roll the dough away from you, but it can be tricky because the dough has the tendency to spring back. Once you have the rectangle, place your block of butter in the middle and fold the top half and bottom half of the dough over and pinch it together. If you peek, you should be able to see butter on the sides.

Once sealed, roll it out for the first turn.
Perform turn 1. The whole secret of making flaky laminated dough, like croissant dough, is to do several “turns.” Basically, we roll out the dough into a larger rectangle, then fold and turn it 90° before rolling again. So, starting at the seam, roll the dough and butter out to a rectangle about 22 inches long and 9 inches wide. Fold the bottom third of the dough up and the top third down, as if you’re folding a letter, and lightly press the dough together. Place on your baking sheet lined with parchment, wrap in plastic, and freeze for 20 minutes. You freeze between turns to keep the butter cold so it doesn’t melt into the flour. If it melts in, you’ll have a nice buttery dough, but it won’t be flaky.

Keep the open seam to your right when you make a “turn.”

Rolled out and ready for another folding.
Perform turn 2. Place your dough on the lightly-floured work surface with the last fold on your right (so it has been rotated 90°) and a narrow edge right in front of you, and roll it out just as before. Dust with a small amount of flour as needed and roll out to a rectangle 22 inches long and 9 inches wide. Fold just as in turn 1. After folding, professional bakers will press two fingers into the dough to make slight indentations so they don’t forget how many turns they’ve completed. You can do that, too. Then wrap and freeze for 20 minutes.

Professionals mark the dough with fingerprints. If you make croissant dough by hand, do it! You’ve earned it.

Almost done for the day; this was the last turn.
Perform turn 3. Repeat everything you did for turn 2, only press three fingers in at the end. And, yes, don’t forget to freeze for 20 minutes.

Roll. Once again, take the dough from the freezer and roll it out to form a rectangle. This time, try to roll it out to 24 x 9 inches. We weren’t able to get it to quite that size, as the dough kept springing back, but we came close. As always, add a dusting of flour, if needed. But, this time, feel free to place the dough in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes if the butter is starting to come through. Once you’re happy with your rectangle, you’re almost finished for the day. Whew!
Roll dough back out, then slice into two, easy-to-manage pieces.
Cut. Nope, don’t cut croissants, but do cut the rectangle in half to form two rectangles, each about 9 by 12 inches. Place one on your parchment-lined sheet, place another piece of parchment on top of the dough sheet, then place the second dough sheet on top of that. Wrap in plastic, refrigerate, and congratulate yourself. Once you clean up, you’re done for the day.

All that hard work made these laminations of dough and butter. Good job!

Day 3 (the tasty day):
Prepare. Prepare yourself for a treat: fresh, homemade croissants. Also, line two baking sheets with parchment or silicone baking mats.
Roll out dough. Take one of the pieces of dough from the refrigerator; leave the other one chilling. On a lightly-floured surface, roll the dough into a rectangle (or as close as you can get it) about 19 x 9 inches in size.
Trim off the uneven edges so you can start with a (pretty) nice rectangle. Cut it down the middle.
Trim. Cut off any ragged edges so you have a nice rectangle of dough. Save those pieces to bake up as a chef’s snack or test pieces. Slice the dough lengthwise down the middle to form two rectangles about 18 x 4 1/2 inches.

We wanted to make both pain au chocolat and mini croissants, so we cut each side of the dough appropriately.
Shape croissants. Slice one of the rectangles into 6 smaller rectangles, about 3 x 4 1/2 inches in size. Slice each of the rectangles diagonally to form triangles. Working with a single triangle at a time, stretch or roll out so the triangles is approximately 6 inches long. Place the triangle so the long point is pointing away from you, fold in the two points nearest you, and roll up the dough tightly. Place on a baking sheet with the point on the bottom and press down lightly so the croissant won’t unroll. Repeat with the remaining triangles.

After stretching a triangle, fold the corners in and roll it right up.

Place croissants on prepared sheets with the point on the bottom, and press them down a bit so they don’t unroll.

For pain au chocolat, roll these rectangles out to about 4 inches long.
Shape pain au chocolat. Here’s a bonus. You can make chocolate-filled croissants, too. All you need to do is shape them differently and fill them with a bit of chocolate. Starting with the other long rectangle, cut it into about nine rectangles, each about 2 x 4 1/2 inches in size. Slice each of these in half to make small rectangles (2 x 2 1/4 inches). Working with one piece at a time, roll and stretch the dough to form a rectangle about 2 by 4 inches. Press about 6 chocolate chips into the middle, then fold one end up and over the chips, then the other end up and over the dough, as if you were folding a small letter. You might see the chocolate peeking out the unfolded sides. Place these on the sheets with the folded sides down, pressing lightly to keep them from unrolling. Repeat with the remaining pieces.

A few chocolate chips is all you need, then fold it up.

Place the folded side of the croissants on the bottom; press down to prevent unrolling.

You can shape the other piece of dough now, or you can wrap it well and freeze it for up to a month. We froze ours so we could enjoy fresh croissants in the coming weeks.
Brush croissants with a bit of egg wash to keep them moist.
Brush with egg wash. In a small bowl or measuring cup, whisk together the egg and ice water, then lightly brush the tops of the croissants and pain au chocolat to coat. This will help keep the croissants moist during baking. When finished, don’t discard the egg wash; you’ll use it again right before these go into the oven.

Here’s our improvised proofing cabinet — a plastic storage bin.
Proof. Cover the pastries with cardboard boxes or plastic tubs — we placed ours in an old sweater storage box and closed the lid — anything that will keep drafts away from the pastries and will allow the dough to rise unheeded. Once covered, let them rise undisturbed, for about 2 hours. If properly proofed, they’ll jiggle a bit when touched.

Preheat oven to 350°F. You’re in the home stretch now!
Brush with egg wash again right before placing into the oven.
Brush with egg wash. Since you didn’t discard your egg wash, re-brush all the pastries with another coat.

Bake. Slide everything into the oven and bake for about 35 minutes, or until the croissants are nicely browned on top and all the edges are completely done.
Mini croissants and pain au chocolat.
Cool. Let the pastries cool on the sheets as long as you can stand it, then enjoy!

While these were good, for the amount of effort involved, they should have been better. We’re sure that’s partly due to our inexperience (we’ve made croissants only once before) and the couple of issues with the ingredients we discussed earlier. Making the turns and rolling out the dough was hard; our dough sprang back quite easily, making it difficult to get the right sized rectangles, which was frustrating.  That said, when these came out of the oven and were just a bit warm, they were delicious, especially the pain au chocolat, but we have another croissant recipe that we’ll try instead. Four stars.

Place croissants on a baking sheet, leaving some room for them  to grow.
 #1. Defrosting
Frozen dough must be defrosted (thaw) first. This will activate yeast.
Never put frozen croissants or danishes into a warm proofer.
–       It takes 1 HOUR at room temperature to correctly thaw
–       Croissants can defrost by leaving them overnight in a cooler.
Product must be covered to prevent drying.
#2. Proofing
-It takes 1 to 1.5 HOUR to proof croissants in a proofer.
Proofer should be set to 80% steam. Temperature should be set to less than 95F (more than 95F will melt the butter in croissants).
– Croissants can be left in room temperature for up to:
7 hours in winter or 4 hours in summer
They must be covered to prevent from drying.
#3 Egg-wash and Decoration
Gently brush croissants with egg-wash (egg and warm water)
#4.  Baking
Bake croissants at 350F for 15-20 min or until golden/brown.

Table Full of Treats



 The saying really is true, it's more fun to share with a friend. I was lucky to have a visit from my friend Sharon, from Ottawa, Ontario. We met last year when we were roommates in Ireland at the Ace Camp Photography workshop with Beatrice PeltreSharon had some time off from work, and was eager to see Wisconsin.  As I prepared for her visit, I started looking at the local Wisconsin landscape through a visitors lens.  What a beautiful place!  Once she arrived I learned that the crops and animals aren't too different from those she grew up with in Canada. But, she was eager to see all the cheese and cheese curds! We drove the Sauk & Dane county countrysides and took in a wine tasting, the Memorial Union in Madison, a few visits to friends' gardens, and cheese!  It was a wonderful few days.






Croissants and Pain au Chocolat



One day we decided to bake and style/photograph some food together.  After all, that's how we met. Sharon was curious about croissants. How fun!  One evening (after a bit too much wine) we made the de trempe, and in the morning we rolled the dough, creating pain au chocolat, croissants, and Morning Buns. Once out of the oven, the pastries became models for our photography, and take home treats for friends who stopped by later that day.

pain-au-chocolat



 Croissants and Pain au Chocolat Recipe(Printer-Friendly Version)Adapted from Peter Reinhart's recipeFor the Dough:4 2/3 cups (595gm) all-purpose flour2 teaspoons salt (10 grams)1⁄3 cup sugar (56 grams)1 tablespoon instant yeast61⁄2 ounces milk ( 200 grams)1 cup water2 tablespoons soft butterFor the Folding Butter:3 sticks cold (11⁄2 cups) unsalted butter, the best you can find2 tablespoons flour1 egg for brushing the croissantsChocolate batons or bittersweet chocolate pieces for pain au chocolatWith a stand mixer fitted with the paddle or by hand, mix the ingredients (except cold butter and 2 tablespoons flour) until shaggy.Gently knead for 1 to 2 minutes until smooth. Dough will be sticky. Place in lightly oiled bowl covered with plastic wrap and chill overnight.The next day, cut the folding butter into 1⁄2-inch pieces, sprinkle with the 2 tablespoons flour, and pound between two pieces of parchment with a rolling pin or beat in mixer with flour until smooth. Be sure to keep the butter cool. Shape into a 6x6 inch square about 1⁄2 inch thick. Return to the refrigerator if your butter feels too soft. \Place the dough on your lightly floured work surface. Roll the dough into a 7x14 inch rectangle. Start with the narrow edge nearest to you. Place the butter square on the bottom half of the dough, and fold the top half over the butter. Lightly seal the edges, and tap with the rolling pin to even out the thicknessTurn the dough one-quarter turn so the fold is on the left and could open like a book Roll the dough, keeping about the same width, to 24 inches in length. Fold the dough into thirds, as you would a letter. Tap the dough to even the thickness, and turn again so the fold is on the left side. You’ve just completed one turn!Cover the dough lightly with plastic wrap and rest at room temperature for 20 minutes. If your room is warmer than 72°F, and you have concern about the dough becoming too soft, you can also rest the dough in the refrigerator.Make two more turns (waiting at least 20 minutes between turns). Remember, if your room isn’t too warm, you don’t need to return to the refrigerator after each turn. Each time you fold the dough, you’re making more and more layers of butter and dough. When the butter heats and melts in the oven, the water in the butter will become steam. The steam pushes the layers of dough apart creating the flaky light layers of the croissants.For croissants, divide the dough into two portions. Roll the first piece of dough into a 6x18 inch rectangle. Cut triangles with a bottom width of about 3 inches.Roll the triangle to lengthen, cut a 1⁄2-inch slit on the bottom edge. Starting at the bottom, roll the dough towards the point, gently stretching the dough. Use both hands, splaying them apart as you roll. The slit will help widen the dough and create a traditional shape. It will take about three to four rolls to reach the end.Place the croissants on a parchment-lined baking sheet, point side down. Repeat with the second portion of dough.For pain au chocolat, cut rectangles measuring 3x4 inches. Place a chocolat baton at each end. Roll/fold each end of the dough toward the center, then each end once again. This will create a scroll shape.Place the dough smooth side up, rolls down, on the baking sheet.When finished shaping, cover and allow the pastries to rise at room temperature for 1 hour.While the dough is rising, preheat your oven to 350°F. Just before baking, beat the egg in a small bowl with a fork. With a pastry brush, gently brush the tops of the croissants with egg wash. Try not to let the egg to drip down the sides of the croissant onto the pan.Bake at 350°F, for 30 minutes. Rotate pan half way through if necessary. Transfer pan to a cooking rack, and allow pastries to cool at least 30 minutes. If you serve the croissants too soon, the butter will not have cooled, and the pastry will have a greasy feel and taste.Morning Buns are a Madison favorite, originating from the Bakers' Rooms and Ovens of Brittany     Restaurants in the 1970's.  For my version:Generously butter a muffin pan.Roll the completed croissant dough out to a 20x8 inch rectangle. Brush the dough lightly with egg/water mixture (1 egg in 1 pint water, mixed well).Mix 2 cups brown sugar and 3 tsp cinnamon and spread on to dough.Roll dough jelly-roll style starting on the long edge.Slice into twelve pieces, about 1 1/2 inches. Place cut side down into each muffin cup. The dough should stand about 1/2 inch above the cup.Place on the pan on a parchment lined baking sheet to catch any drips.Place in the oven right away (no need for 2nd rise), and bake about 35-40 minutes, or until deep golden brown.Remove from the oven, and flip pan oven for the buns to drop out and caramelized sugar to drip onto buns. Allow to cool for 10 minutes.Mix together 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar and 2 tsp cinnamon. Carefully roll warm buns in the sugar mixture and enjoy!Print Friendly",croissant

Croissants from France 







Shipped in a Styrofoam Box with Dry Ice





This is a review of croissants offered by QVC from a company called Authentic Gourmet. They are made in France and shipped to your doorstep. I have been buying them for several years. They have had many different types over the years including whole wheat, lemon filled, raspberry filled and chocolate filled. They offer three sizes mini, classic and large. Currently they are only offering the regular and chocolate filled. Here's your choices of the regular croissant:



20 Large for $39.00, M56345 or A/D M57119, 2.64 lbs., $1.95 each 
25 Large for $49.00, M51595, 3.3 lbs., $1.96 each 
30 Classic for $39.84, M55864, 2.76 lbs., $1.38 each 
40 Large for $59.00, M56367, 5.28 lbs., $1.47 each
48 Large for $66.00, M54348, 6.3 lbs., $1.37 each
50 Large for $64.00, M51596, 6.6 lbs., $1.28 each
60 Large for $79.00, M56369, 7.92 lbs., $1.31 each
65 Classic for $65.34, M54578, 5.73 lbs., $1.00 each


The pricing and sizes can be confusing, just look at all the choices! Note that shipping is free. I have calculated the number of croissants versus the weight to figure out which ones are the largest to help you out. Also, I calculated the price per croissant. Number three and number eight on the list are the medium sized croissants called classic. The rest are the largest size which are good for making sandwiches. When I first ordered them they were all large enough to make into sandwiches. Then they started sending smaller ones that weren't big enough to make into sandwiches, but not small enough to be mini. The ones I purchased that are shown in the above photo are number one on the list, considered to be the largest size. I do not recommend ordering them when your weather is warm or hot. Stick to the cool and cold months of the year to have them shipped. If you have them shipped during the warm or hot months of the year they will arrive with the dry ice melted and the croissants will be partially defrosted and stuck together in one huge clump. QVC will refund your money, but no one wants to be disappointed and it's such a waste. As soon as they arrive I recommend that you remove them from the bag and place them neatly stacked in a freezer ziplock bag. Then place them in the freezer as quickly as possible. The plastic bag they ship them in isn't very sturdy and too large.



To cook them simply preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Place the croissants on a baking sheet with either parchment paper or foil. Rub the side of a stick of butter on the foil and then place the frozen croissant on top. Note above what the top side of the frozen croissant looks like. The bottom side has the end piece of the dough, you'll want to make sure that is resting on the baking sheet to ensure that the croissant puffs up to it's full potential. Once the oven is preheated, place it in the oven and cook for 25-27 minutes. Do not open the door during the cooking process. I use a KitchenAid Countertop Convection Oven that was a QVC TSV and preheat it for three minutes. There's no need to use a regular sized oven unless you are cooking a lot of them at once. You'll want to make only as many as you plan to eat right away since they are best served warm. I recommend adding just a bit of KerryGold Irish Butter and some French preserves from Bonne Maman. They can both be found at Costco. If you are going to make it into a sandwich, you'll want to let it cool a bit before cutting it in half. Be sure to use a bread knife so that the croissant doesn't fall apart when cutting it. If you try to cut it prior to it cooling it will lose it's puffiness and it's more likely to fall apart. Don't think only lunch sandwiches with deli meat, remember egg and cheese breakfast sandwiches are also a delight. 



If you have been as fortunate as myself and have had the joy of eating a croissant in France, you'll know what I mean when I say the French make them taste so much better. You'll also know that their chocolate croissants are much less sweet than the American version and that they use less chocolate. For those of you who have only had American chocolate croissants, don't expect that super sweet candy like flavor. These have more of a hint of chocolate that is light on the sugar. 



I highly recommend you give these delightfully scrumptious croissants a try soon! There is nothing like a freshly baked croissant right out of the oven made by the French! I'm sure you'll be be telling me ""merci beaucoup"" for the recommendation after giving these a taste. Bon Appétit!

Make the butter package: Place a piece of plastic wrap on your work surface (it should be ~16 inches long to hold the resulting 7x7-inch butter package) and sprinkle 1/2 Tbsp of flour in a ~3x4 area of the plastic wrap.
Place the 3 sticks of butter side-by-side on top of the floured square and sprinkle the remaining 1/2 Tbsp flour over top. 

Very loosely cover the butter with the long side of the plastic wrap and holding your rolling pin level to the countertop, pound the butter to ~1/2 inch thickness. 

Uncover, fold the butter in half, cover and repeat twice, finally pounding the butter to a 7in square. Cover tightly and refrigerate until ready to use.

Place warmed milk in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Sprinkle yeast over top and let sit 10 minutes.
Add remaining flour, sugar, and salt and knead until a smooth dough ball forms, about 5 minutes
Add the 2 Tbsp butter and knead until incorporated and dough is smooth, elastic, and slightly sticky, about 5 minutes more. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for an hour.
Roll out the dough into an 11in square. Place the butter package in the middle and fold the dough around the butter, pinching the edges to seal.
 
Using your rolling pin, pound the dough until the dough square becomes more malleable and then roll the dough into a 14in square.

Fold the dough into thirds, like a letter, and then fold that into thirds to form a square. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for two hours.
 
Repeat steps 9 & 10.
Divide the dough in half and roll one half to a 10x20 rectangle. 
Use a knife or a pizza cutter to cut the dough into 3 equal rectangles ~6 1/2 inches wide, and then cut those rectangles along the diagonal - you will get 6 triangles.
Repeat using the other half of the dough.

Working with one triangle at a time, gently stretch the dough so that both long sides are of equal length - for the first time since 9th grade geometry, I get to use the words ""isosceles triangle"" - and cut a ~1 inch slit in the short side of the dough triangle.

Beginning with the two edges of the slit, roll the triangle outward, away from you, lightly stretching the dough as you go.

Tuck the point of the triangle under the croissant and fold the corners towards the center, pinching them together (they won't stay together when baked, but it helps them keep shape).

Place on the baking sheet and repeat the rolling steps for the remaining triangles.

Croissants are made from a yeasted dough laminated with butter. It is so so good.The trick is to keep the dough and the butter at the same temperature and texture, to prevent soft butter bleeding out of the dough. A too cold dough will crack a bit, so you are looking for a firm but yet soft dough.There are different kinds of folding/turning when it comes to pastry and croissant dough. Letter fold or Single turn: Dough folded in thirds, like you would do a letter going into an envelope. (I did that for this recipe.)1. Turn: makes 3 layers of butter2. Turn: makes 9 layers of butter3. Turn: makes 27 layers of butter.Book fold or double turn: Dough folded to the middle and folded again on the middle like a book. This makes 4 layers per fold or turn as they are called.1. Turn: makes 4 layers of butter2. Turn: makes 16 layers of butter3. Turn: makes 64 layers of butterYou can mix the folding methods to get the amount of layer you want. Theoretically you can make how many layers you want, but making too many layers makes you end up with a brioche dough, made the hardest way possible 😉.   At the croissant class I attended I learned that Manresa Bread use 2 double turns (16 layers) for regular croissants, and 3 single turns (27 layers) for chocolate croissants. For traditional Danish pastry you normally use 3 single turns, giving the desired 27 layers of butter. If you are looking for a traditional puff pastry, you need 144 layers Makes this 20-24 croissants. Ingredients:Dough/Détrempe:750 g bread flour200 g water, lukewarm187.5 g milk90 g sugar22.5 g salt65 g live yeast (15 g dry yeast)7.5 g malt powder37.5 g butter, room temperatureBeurrage (butter):450 g cold butterall-purpose flour for dustingDirections:Dough/Détrempe:Mix the milk with the water, dissolve the yeast in this mixture. Add the sugar. If using dry yeast, let the yeast wake up for about 5-10 minutes, until creating a foam on top. Mix in half of the flour and malt powder, forming a sticky dough. Mix in the softened butter. Finally mix in the rest of the flour and knead the dough until you have a shiny, slightly sticky and elastic dough, for about 3-5 minutes. The dough will be a bit on the dry/tough side.Shape dough into a ball and place it in a dough rising bucket, or another large covered container. Let the dough fermented overnight, this will give you a good flavor.Beurrage (butter):Place the cold butter on a well floured surface. With your palms press the butter a little flat. Using a rolling pin pound on the butter to flatten it. Fold the butter into it self, and keep pounding and folding until the butter has the same consistency as the dough. You want to end up with a 30x32 cm (11x12.5 inch) sheet of soft but still cold butter. If the butter is too warm or too hard, it will be hard to roll it out in the dough, and it might make holes in the dough, instead of the lamination.If you don't want to add any flour to your butter, you can pound and roll out the butter between sheets of parchment paper. Chill the butter while you roll out the dough. Laminating:Place dough on a lightly floured surface, roll it out to 62x32 cm (24.5x12.5 inch), so the dough is the width of the butter, but a little over double in length. Clearly I rolled my dough longer than necessary, but it worked fine anyway. Place the butter on the dough, and wrap it with the dough, pinching the edges, meeting in the middle of the dough, together. Chill the dough package covered in the refrigerator for about 15-20 minutes, before starting the folding/turning.







Roll the dough to a rectangle, 3-4 times as long as the height. Keep it lightly floured so the dough do not stick to the surface. Make sure to roll the dough with straightedges. This will ease the folding.Fold the far edges into the middle and fold again on the middle like a book. Now you have 4 layers of butter. Place the covered dough in the freezer for about 20 minutes to cool the butter again, and to relax the gluten.Repeat this one more time, making 2 double (book) turns and ending up with 16 layers of butter. If you want to use this dough for Danish pastry or chocolate croissants, I would make 3 single turns, so you end up with 27 layers.Before shaping the croissants you want the dough to rest covered in the refrigerator for at least 45-60 minutes. And letting it sit covered for 5 minutes on the kitchen counter, letting the butter to soften up a bit.Shaping the croissants:







Roll half the dough out to a 20x40 cm (8x16 inch) rectangle. Using a knife or pizza slicer to cut the dough. Cut the croissant triangles as shown in the picture. (you get 7, not 5 croissants from the dough, I missed the last 2 in the picture, sorry). Let the dough rest covered 5 minutes to relax the gluten a bit. Stretch the triangle, so you elongate it, be careful not to rip the dough. Roll the dough towards the tip of the triangle, making sure that the tip is on the underside of the croissant.Place the croissant on a parchment paper lined baking sheet, spaced at least 5 cm (2 inch) apart.Proof the croissant covered at maximum 85℉ (29.5℃) for 45-60 minutes until doubled in size. I have a proof setting on my oven, so I can use that, with a cup of boiling water sitting next to the baking sheet. But you can also proof the croissant on the kitchen counter, in a large air filled plastic bag.Presheat oven to 350℉  (177℃) convection or 375℉ (190℃) foer non-convection.Gently brush the croissants with egg wash, covering the exposed surfaces not allowing the egg wash to drip or pool.Bake the croissants for 15-20 minutes, until golden brown. Let the croissants on the baking sheet on the kitchen counter. Serve the croissants within a day. Enjoy!







 Tip:The unbaked pastry can be frozen just, after shaping, individually, and can be baked straight out of the freezer, just add about 5 more minutes to the baking time. Tip:Leftover croissants can be used for almond croissants. Make some frangipan (125 g almond flour, 125 g butter, 125 g powdered sugar, 12 g all-purpose flour and 1 large egg, all mixed together) and smear it inside the croissant, and on top, before baking it for xx minutes.

recipe notes
step-by-step method
recipe card
As a pastry chef, there are two questions I get asked allll the time:

What is your favorite dessert to eat?
What is your favorite thing to make?

I don’t have an answer to the first question because it really depends. Sometimes I want a “symphony” (who says that? Gross.) of textures and flavors that push the outer-most boundaries of modern gastronomy, sometimes I want a Snickers. But the second question is a no-brainer: My favorite thing to make in all of pastry over the span of my entire career is croissants.
I love to make croissants because I love to eat them. I don’t think of them as dessert, but they are the one and only thing I don’t get tired of eating day after day in my pastry kitchen. I love to make croissants because I can’t help but admit there’s a romantic connection to the dough as you work with it. It’s alive, it has moods. You use your hands, get dirty and craft something beautiful (somewhere out there, a hipster just got a hard on). I love to make croissants because they’re so damn challenging to do well consistently, and if you lose focus anywhere along the way, they can be ruined.
Hold on there, don’t leave just yet! A little hard work and difficulty is part of what makes it fun. With some practice you’ll be knee deep in ‘ssants in no time. And when you start to feel frustration build, just remember: if Kim Kardashian can operate a vehicle, you can roll, shape and bake some dough.
I’m going to give you two slightly different methods for croissants. One method is for any pros out there that have a sheeter in their work kitchens. The other method is for any weekend warriors who want to make croissants at home. The difference between the two methods is really just mixing times in order to manage the amount of gluten development and in turn how firm your dough is.
In pro kitchens a dough sheeter is pretty standard, and it’s infinitely stronger and more efficient at rolling out dough than two arms and a rolling pin, so it can handle much colder, tougher dough in order to A. actually roll it out and B. not overwork it which would cause it to shrink up. At home, you’ll have at most a stand mixer with a dough hook to work with and all of the rolling and shaping will be manual, so the “home” recipe requires less overall mixing for a softer, more manageable dough. Yes, technically a stronger, more developed dough will have a better oven spring (the initial rise during baking) and a lighter honeycomb (the term for the internal crumb of a croissant) but don’t worry, both recipes will give you some bomb-ass croissants. And for all of you pros out there that make your croissants 100% by hand at work (you know who you are) you have my official stamp of badass approval.

recipe notes
lamination
Croissants fall in a family of laminated dough and a good croissant hinges on good lamination. Lamination is the process of creating lots of thin, alternating layers of butter and dough. When baked, the butter separates the layers of dough creating a uniform flakiness. This means that one of the most important things to remember when making your croissants is to keep the dough as cold as possible while you work with it. Once you start to laminate the dough, you’ll be dealing with paper-thin layers of butter. A little heat can mash those butter layers into the dough and into each other, ruining the honeycomb of a good croissant. The last stage of the game, where you cut and shape your croissants, is the most critical time to keep that dough nice and cold. When in doubt, chill!
proofing
Croissant dough will require proofing more than once throughout the recipe. Just to get real basic for a minute, proofing is a controlled rise of your dough in an environment that is warm and humid, conditions that promote yeast development which in turn promotes development of gasses. Those gasses are what create lightness and volume in your dough. In short, proofing and proofing right is absolutely crucial to making a good croissant.
This can be the biggest challenge for a home baker, and I myself have resorted to using a steamy shower to help dough rise. There are plenty of small, home use proofers you can buy on the market, but I don’t recommend them, only because there’s a much cheaper and easier alternative that you already own: your oven. Generally, adding a pan of just-about-to-boil water to your oven will both increase the humidity and the temperature enough to proof your dough. If you need a little extra heat, you can turn the oven on for a minute or two to give it just enough kick to warm it up for proofing. I use a hygrometer (cheap and easy to find) to monitor both the humidity and temperature of the oven while proofing, and simply switch out steamy water if either condition drops too much.
dough hydration
To make the base croissant dough (also known as the detremp; say “deh-tromp”), you will have to hydrate it with whole milk. There are times when you may need to add more milk to the dough or reserve some, depending on how humid the weather may be. In the winter, I almost always add a bit more milk and then in the summer almost always reserve just a bit. What’s key is knowing the proper texture of the dough to know that it is fully hydrated. Properly hydrated dough will allow full, strong gluten development. If your dough lacks enough water to fully develop gluten, the overall structure and rise of the croissant will suffer. Too much hydration and the dough will be soft and won’t laminate well with the butter. Nicely hydrated dough will feel slightly moist to the touch and have good flexibility but still maintain some tension. The best thing you can do is take careful note of the dough and how it feels with each batch of croissants you make and adjust as needed the next time around.
ingredient notes

Definitely take the time to source a good quality bread flour and high fat, unsalted butter (82% minimum). I’ve really liked using plugra, and amazingly you can find it in grocery stores all over. I’ve also liked elle and vire, which even makes dry butter blocks specifically for laminating, but as you can probably imagine, they are expensive and hard to find.
Adding flour to your butter to create your butter block is a trick I learned from a much better baker than myself – Benjamin Sevinn – which helps to simulate the beurre sec or dry butter that is ideal to use for laminated doughs but basically impossible to find on a regular basis in regular stores.
There are a ton of variations to croissants out there, some calling for eggs, other whole wheat flour. Some use a levain starter, some (like this one) a poolish. I think of this recipe as a pretty classic, French dude in a striped shirt and beret on a bicycle kind of croissant. Try it to start and change it as you like from there!
Most importantly be patient, grasshopper, croissants take time. This will be a two-day process with lots of dough resting. Yes, there will be a lot of waiting, but that’s why humans invented beer and bourbon.

croissants
207g water
15g dry yeast
152g bread flour (A)
60g sugar
17g salt
235g whole milk*
82g butter (A) at room temp.
690g bread flour (B)
453g butter (B) for butter block
100g all purpose flour for butter block
*more may be needed/added depending on ambient humidity
To start, you need to create a butter block. This will serve as basically all of the butter in the recipe and will be the butter that is rolled thin and layered to create flakiness. Combine the 453g of butter (B) with the all purpose flour and mix until they are well incorporated.


Place a piece of plastic wrap down and your butter mixture on top. Use your hands or a spatula to spread the mixture and approximate a block that is 10×7″/ 25x18cm.



Use a rolling pin to gently smooth and even out the butter block, making sure it’s even in thickness. If the block is the correct size, it should wind up being about 1/2″/1.27cm thick. Chill the block in the fridge until you’re ready to use it.

To start your dough, combine the water (at room temperature), dry yeast and bread flour (A). Whisk the ingredients together until homogenized and let sit, undisturbed, in a warm place for 30-40min. This pre-fermentation is known as a poolish, and letting the mixture rest will activate the yeast and help develop flavor.




After 30 to 40 minutes the poolish will start to rise and bubble. And smell a-maz-iiiing.

Add the remaining whole milk, butter (A), bread flour (B), salt and sugar and mix on low speed with a dough hook for about 3min or until the dough comes together and begins to develop. At this stage you’ll see that the gluten is still quite weak, and the dough will easily tear.


You can see clear evidence of gluten development, but overall the dough lacks enough structure to hold together.

If making the dough in a pro kitchen, increase to medium speed for the second round of mixing. At home, keep the speed on low and develop the dough until it forms a strong gluten network. You can check the dough by gently stretching it out until a “window” of dough thin enough to see light through is created. If the window tears before it is stretched thin enough, more mixing is needed. The key word for this test is gentle. If you’re rough with your dough, it will tear no matter how strong the gluten may be. Dough is no match for you.


When making the croissants at home, the mixing time will be anywhere from 3 to 6 minutes. Over mixing the dough will form great gluten but make rolling a nightmare down the road. On the other hand, if you’re making this recipe in a professional kitchen, I mix anywhere from 12 to 14 minutes to develop a strong gluten network.
Place the dough in a bowl with plastic wrap loosely covering to touch. Proof the dough for 1 hour or until it doubles in volume.


Press the dough down, expelling any gasses that have formed during proofing, and spread it out evenly onto a non-stick baking mat. I’ve worked my recipe so that if you roll the dough to the inner edge of a baking mat border it will be the perfect size to add your butter. That being said, you’re looking for a rectangle of dough that is 10×15″/25x38cm.


Again, loosely place plastic wrap over the dough to touch* and rest it in the freezer for 1 hour and then the fridge for 1 hour until it is thoroughly chilled. Alternately, you could leave the dough in the freezer at this point and defrost it to the same chilled temp. when you are ready for the next step.
*Wrapping the dough too tightly will trap gasses that continue to develop during proofing which can alter the flavor or final texture of the croissant.

Now it’s time to combine the dough and butter to start laminating! First, remove the butter from the cooler and let it temper slightly. The butter should be cold but flexible. If the butter cracks when you try to flex it, it’s too cold. If it feels warm…well…it’s too warm. Lightly tapping the block of butter with the length of a rolling pin can help to temper it quickly and evenly.
Place the butter in the center of the dough block and fold the dough over the butter on either side to meet in the middle, like closing the doors of a cupboard. Lightly pinch the dough together down the center line where it meets to create a seal.



If you’re making these at home, then using the right technique to roll the dough out is very important at this stage. This is where the butter and dough have the most tenuous relationship, because they haven’t truly fused together yet. The wrong way to roll croissant dough is like you would for a pie; pressing the pin down on one edge of the dough and pushing across the dough to the other edge. This method will push the butter out from the dough, instead of simultaneously thinning the dough and butter together.
The right method is to press straight down and roll back and forth in a tight section of the block of dough. Then lift up the pin, move further up the block of dough and repeat. Once you’ve rolled the dough out enough that the butter and dough have well fused, you can go back to a more traditional method of rolling.
One way or the other, roll the dough to three times its length (which will bring the dough to somewhere between ½”/1.27cm and ¼”/6mm. At work we roll the dough down to #7 on our sheeter or ½”/1.27cm.

Once the dough is rolled out, you’re ready to give it its first fold. How you fold your dough and how often is an art form (or science depending on how you look at it) in and of itself. Giving your croissant dough folds will exponentially increase the amount of layers of butter and flour, creating flakiness. There will be lots of time and croissants for you to experiment with your folds, but for this recipe we’re going to give the dough three single folds.
To make your first single fold, envision the length of dough in three equal sections – left, center and right. Fold the left section in toward the center like closing a book. Fold the right section over the first two…like closing a book from the other side I guess. Single fold complete. This will give you a block of dough (or book of dough) with open seems at the top and bottom of the “book.”



Here’s a close up of one of the open seams.

For the second, single fold you will roll the dough again to three times its length (with the open seams forming the far left and right edges in the wide photo above) and fold the dough once more in thirds. I figured a little diagram might clear things up for anyone scratching their head.

After the second single fold you want to rest your dough for 1 hour in the freezer and 1 hour in the cooler. This will allow the gluten that has formed to rest and keep the dough chilled. After the rest give the dough a third and final single fold. At this point I generally rest the dough overnight in the fridge (8 to 12 hours). If you need longer than that to begin the next step, simply freeze the dough and defrost until still chilled to make your final roll.
The final roll of dough will draw out its length down to 1/8”/3mm instead of the ¼”/6mm of the single folds (#3 on a sheeter). The length of the dough will vary but it should be 9”/23cm wide. Again, the size of the triangles that you cut and shape is up to personal preference and style. For our croissants, we’re going to cut out triangles that are 9”/23cm long and 4.5”/11.4cm wide at the base.


Measure out 4.5”/11.4cm sections along the length of one edge of the dough, making small cuts to mark them. Move to the opposite edge of the dough and make more 4.5”/11.4cm sections, but this time off centered to the original sections.




Notice how the 4.5″ sections are offset from one edge to the next to provide a triangle cutting guide. Magic!

Using a long chef’s knife or a pizza cutter, cut out triangles that will soon become your croissants.

Before shaping your croissants, remember that at this point the layers of butter and dough are at their thinnest and so most susceptible to smashing together and ruining good lamination. Handle the croissants as little as possible so you don’t warm the dough too much and always use light pressure.
To shape your croissants, start at the base of the triangle. Tightly roll the base over itself to start to roll the croissant up.


Using light pressure on your ring fingers and pinkies and keeping your hands angled up towards your index fingers, roll the croissant up to the halfway point.


To finish, gently grip the the points of the croissant with your index fingers and thumbs and twist the croissant to roll it up the final point, keeping the point centered in the croissant. The point of the triangle should just fall under the croissant, held in place there. Practice. Practice. Practice.   ….and practice.



Once your croissants are shaped, you can move on to the next steps to bake them or freeze them to defrost and bake later. However! The longer the croissants are in the freezer, the slower and weaker the yeast will react. I don’t freeze my croissants for more than three or four days.

Brush the shaped croissants with egg wash and proof them for 2-3hrs. at no higher than 80F and ideally 80-90% humidity. If butter leaks from the croissants during proofing, than your temperature is too high! Knowing when the croissants are properly proofed is tricky. Too little, and they croissants will have weak rise and a dense, chewy center. Too much, and the croissants may puff up but the honeycomb will be tight and spongey.
A properly proofed croissant will obviously increase in volume but will feel soft to the touch while retaining tension. Some people shake the pan a little to see the croissants jiggle a bit then settle. All very high tech, I know.

I just use a simple hotel pan with lightly boiling water to add heat and humidity to my “proofer.”


Not proofed.


Proofed.


Seeing the laminated layers separating is a good sign that the dough is proofed properly.

Give the croissants a second coat of egg wash and bake at 375F for 15 to 20min. They should be a deep brown (none of that blond costco sh*t) and feel light in the hand, which is a good sign that enough water has baked out.

Beautifully, uniquely un-perfect homemade croissants.


I hope all of you pastry fiends out there see this recipe as a fun challenge and exciting new arena of baking passion. There’s no substitute for lots of practice, and luckily even a bad croissant is pretty damn good. Get baking!
Cheers – Chef Scott

Add the whole milk, sugar, salt, butter (A), and bread flour (B) to the started and mix with a dough hook on low speed for 3min until the dough comes together. 





Continue mixing the dough on low speed for 3-5min at home or medium speed for 12-14min in a professional kitchen until the dough is full strengthened.  





Place the dough in a mixing bowl and loosely cover with plastic wrap. Proof for one hour or until doubled in volume. 





Press excess gas out of the dough and shape it into a block that is 10x15""/25x38cm. 





Temper the butter block until it is flexible but still chilled. 





Place the butter block centered on the dough and fold the dough over the block creating a seam down the center. Pinch the dough together to seal the seam. 





Roll the dough to three times its length (approx. 30"") and give a single fold, folding the dough over itself in thirds. Turn the dough 90 degrees and repeat the process to give a second, single fold. 





Rest the dough in the freezer for one hour and then in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Repeat the folding process to give a third and final single fold. 





Rest the dough in the refrigerator for 8 to 12 hours. 





Roll the dough out to 1/8"" thickness and 9"" width. The length of the dough will vary. 





Mark one length of the dough in 4.5"" sections. Mark the opposite edge in 4.5"" sections offset to the first set of marking. 





Using a chef's knife or a pizza cutter, cut triangles of dough 9"" long and 4.5"" wide at the base. 





Roll the triangles up from the base, using light pressure on your ring and pinkie fingers. Roll the triangle halfway to completion and switch your grip. 





Using your index fingers and thumbs, lightly grip the ends of the croissants and use a twisting motion to finish rolling the croissants. 





Egg wash the croissants and proof them for 2 to 2.5 hours at 80F and 80-90% humidity. Give the croissants a second coat of egg wash before baking. 





Bake: 375F; 14-20min.

Pour in the water and mix until thoroughly combined. The mixture should have the consistency of a thin pancake batter.Cover the bowl loosely with cling film and let it sit at room temperature for 12-15 hours. The mixture will be bubbly and ready for use.Make a butter block by combining the butter on a piece of grease proof paper, then place another piece of paper on top and hit the butter with a rolling pin to begin to flatten it. Keep flattening the butter into a rectangle that is 15cm x 20cm.Wrap it tightly in the grease proof paper and refrigerate it until you are ready to use it.To make the croissant dough, mix the flour, sugar and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook and give it a quick mix on the lowest setting to distribute all of the ingredients evenly.Pour about half the water around the edges of the bowl of poolish to help release it, then add the contents of the bowl along with the water (holding back 50g) to the mixer.Add the butter and mix on low speed for 2 minutes to moisten the dry ingredients. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl to make sure all the flour has been incorporated.Sprinkle the salt over the top and mix on low speed for 2 minutes to dissolve the salt. If the mixture feels at all dry add the reserved water in very small amounts as needed. Continue to mix on low speed for 20 minutes.Run a bowl scraper around the sides and bottom of the bowl to release the dough and turn out onto the work surface. Stretch the left side of the dough outward and fold it over the centre of the dough, then stretch and fold the right side over to the opposite side, as if you were folding a letter.Repeat the process working from the bottom and then the top. Turn the dough over, lift it with a bench scraper and place the dough back in the mixing bowl. Cover with cling film and leave to sit at room temperature for an hour.Prepare a baking tray with baking parchment, uncover the dough and use a dough scraper to release the dough and turn it out onto a floured surface. Gently but firmly pat the dough into a rectangle approximately 25cm by 19cm, press any large gas bubbles out of the dough and place the dough on the baking tray and put it in the freezer for 20 minutes.Lightly flour the work surface and a heavy rolling pin. Turn the dough out onto the work surface and lightly dust the top with flour. Roll the dough outward from the centre, rotating it frequently and flipping and fluffing it from time to time, adding just enough flour to the work surface, dough and or pin to prevent it sticking until you have a rectangle of dough that is around 1cm thick.Lay the butter block across the centre of the dough, stretch and fold over the two longer sides so they meet in the centre and pinch them together to seal.Using the rolling pin, press down firmly on the dough across the seam from one side to the other to expand the dough. Turn the dough so a short end faces you. Roll to expand the length of the dough turning the dough over and adding flour only as needed, until you have a rectangle that is 50cm by 22cm and 1cm thick.Fold the bottom third of the dough up as if you were folding a letter. Fold the top third down to cover the bottom third. Turn the block 90 degrees, so the dough resembles a book with the opening on the right. This completes the first turn, return the dough to the pan, cover with clingfilm and freeze for 20 minutes until the dough is stiffened but not hard.For the second turn, lightly dust the work surface with flour, place the dough on the surface with the opening on the right. Work quickly with the dough so it doesn't warm up, but be careful not to expose the butter.Expand the dough by pressing firmly with the rolling pin, working up the length of the dough. If it cracks, stop a minute and let the dough warm a bit more at room temperature. Roll out the dough as before to a rectangle that is 50cm by 22cm and 1cm thick. Repeat the letter fold as before and return the dough to the freezer for 20 minutes.For the final turn repeat the same as the step above and then place the dough back in the freezer for 20 minutes. Cut the dough crosswise in half, making two rectangles. Cover two baking trays with parchment paper.Lightly flour the work surface. Remove one piece of dough from the freezer and position it on the work surface with the short end towards you; transfer the second piece of dough (if using at this time) to the fridge.Roll the dough out to a rectangle 50cm x 20cm. Turn the dough so that a long side is facing you and trim it to a neat rectangle. Trim the remaining sides only as needed for straight edges.Cut the dough in half, so that you have two squares. Then cut each square in half so that you end up with four rectangles. Cut each rectangle diagonally so that you end up with 8 right triangles.Hold one triangle up by the base with one hand and, using your fingertips, gently pull the dough until it is stretched to about 30cm.Put the dough on the work surface, with the base of the triangle close to you. cut a snip in the middle of the base about 1.5cm long, roll the dough up from the wide end to the tip. Put on a prepared sheet with the tail tucked under. Repeat with the remaining 7 triangles of dough, spacing them evenly on the baking tray.If baking all the croissants now, repeat these steps with the remaining dough in the fridge until you have 16 croissants.Brush the croissants with the egg wash, cover the pans with plastic tubs or cardboard boxes and let prove for about 2 hours.Position the racks in the upper and lower two-thirds of the oven. Preheat to 170C Fan/190C/350°F.Brush the croissants again with egg wash. Bake for 35-40 minutes, rotating the pans once halfway through baking and separating the croissants if they are touching, until the tops are a rich golden brown and no portions, particularly between the layers, look under cooked.

We're baaaaaaaack!



This week's Trader Joe's review brings us to breakfast. We're reviewing Trader Joe's Almond Croissants.
You'll find these in the freezer section.  They come in a box of 4 for $4.49.

One thing you must know about these is that they have to rise OVERNIGHT. Don't forget or you'll be kicking yourself in the morning.

Here's how they look straight out of the box...


And, after rising overnight...



They get really, really poofy. (I put the ruler there for comparison, but they really just expand up, not out.) ;)

In the morning, you'll bake for 20 minutes, then let them cool for 10 minutes before eating (AKA: torture).


A mom's (my) review: I'm wondering...would it be too much to have these for breakfast every day for the rest of my life? I'm serious, would it? Oh my gosh, these are perfection. Flaky, buttery, and filled with a sweet and lightly cinnamon-y almond filling...these croissants are EVERYTHING. They smell heavenly, too. You know how some croissants can be dry and you end up with more in your lap than in your mouth? Not so with these. The outer layer is crispy with a soft interior. I will absolutely have a stash of these in the freezer the next time we have overnight guests (and, possibly for every day).
Overall rating: 5 of 5 stars

A teenager's (Jack's) review: I am a HUGE fan of croissants. But these are something special... First, you start with a slightly crunchy, buttery outside (which is incredibly tasty). Then, the inside, complemented with a layer of almond paste towards the bottom of the croissant, contrasts very nicely with the buttery outside. A sprinkling of powdered sugar, as in this case, is always a nice add-on.

- The Best WayIf you’re wondering “What is the secret to adding water to an oven,” “What is the science behind what goes on with steam ovens” or simply, ""How to steam bread."" Then like me, it’ll probably bug you for years until you find the way that works best for you.Maybe believing a theory along your bread baking journey which turns out later to scientifically not correct...(Yes, me)After years of bread baking combined with a few months of intense ""steam"" and ""adding water"" research, I’ve got the problem dialled down for you.This article shares the best way to use steam to bake the most perfect light and crusty bread.Why is adding water important when baking bread?Adding some water to the oven creates a moistened environment, this allows the bread to rise easier by delaying the setting of the crust. It makes bread deliciously light and crusty.How it does this, and why, we'll cover in detail later on in this post.Is it steam or water?Before we begin with the juicy stuff, I’m just going to make you aware that I use the terms “water” and “steam” interchangeably.Adding water to a hot oven creates steam. This is the point of adding water. When talking with other bakers we tend to lean on the “adding steam” phrase. So adding water or adding steam, either is good.What professional bakers learn about baking with steamMy journey to understand baking with steam started a while back. Most professional bakers learn about using steam in the oven in a kind of backward way. Let me share a conversation:I was sat in a coffee shop with John, a supermarket baker of 20 years. He is one of the most passionate bakers that I’ve had the pleasure of working with. John would make spot-on bread every bake.He never made mistakes.I'd often wondered why he hadn't pushed himself down a more artisan route in bread baking. He was one of a few people I knew who would be able to handle the more complicated processes and techniques with ease. He was fantastic.Anyway, enough of hosting his ego. Let’s get back to the point...Whilst sipping my latte, naturally the conversation turned to bread. I told him I was starting to write this article, he showed an interest.I asked him “What do you understand about using steam in the oven?”His reply was typical to many heard before. It had not progressed.“It makes the bread go crusty”To be fair, I couldn't argue with him.It is true,but, there’s more to it than crusty.So I fired a quick trio of more challenging questions:“How much steam to add?”“Why does it do what it does?”“What are the other benefits of steam? ”To these questions John stalled, but as we conversed, it all made perfect sense...Many bakers including myself rely on old wives tales or assumptions when understanding how adding water to the oven works. They get passed through the ranks in every bakery establishment.Often though (here's the thing...) they are not the full picture. My definition of adding water to the oven (to create steam) a year or two ago was very similar to Johns. Now I know that creating steam by adding water into the oven is a bigger subject.Knowing the science behind team baking bread isn’t vital to baking a loaf of bread. All you have to do is follow a process to create steam.For the full benefits of the addition of steam, you should get a baking stone if you don't have one already.Here is the one I recommend due to it's heat distribution and durability: It's an affiliate link so buying with this link helps the site with a small commission.Pour the water -> Close the door -> Run away (how I first learned to add water to an oven)I’ve explored many ways to add steam to an oven over my years in bread baking. My desire to conquer it started back when I was a supermarket baker with John. The steam injectors would regularly bread in the deck ovens we were using.Apparently we had dirty water in our pipes or something?After the engineers had repeatedly attempted to repair, our baking team decided to learn how to create steam ourselves.The Pour, Close & Run strategy was the technique that we used. It works by chucking a cup of tap water onto the baking stone as we dropped the bread in.It works pretty well, it would create enough steam sometimes too much if we got carried away. There was a slight worry that the sudden attack of cold water might shatter the baking stone.But they weren’t our ovens, so we didn't really care!(bad I know)I used the ""Pour, Close & Run"" technique hundreds of times in my career, then one day it occurred to me...“What is actually going on?”After many years of baking, I still don’t know, not really anyway!... So I set out to find the truth about adding water to an ovenHaving strong technical knowledge helps bakers make the best quality bread. Any extra advantage benefits home bakers, especially when starting out. The equipment used in pro bakeries is a higher quality and helps “paper over the cracks”.It’s easier to learn bread baking as a job than studying at home. I felt I needed to learn everything about this topic so I could share it with you to give you an advantage.How a professional baker adds water to an oven to make steamSteam jets are fitted in the ovens. The jets are powered by a tank storing pressured water. When the oven demands it, the jets are opened and water is released into the oven. Depending on the type of steam system the oven uses it can take a few minutes after use for them to be ready to spray again.It may sound great, but there are always issues with pipes clogging up and expensive repair charges. At least, I’ve found that in hard water areas it's sometimes not worth bothering with the repair costs.They constantly get jammed.I’ve not found a reliable situation. I tend to use the techniques commonly used for home use in a commercial bakery.At least I know they work every time.THE BEST WAY TO ADD WATER TO AN OVENThis is a combination of methods shown below. It allows plenty of steam to get into the oven and stay there!Domestic ovens are not as well sealed as commercial ones so you have to over-steam in most home setups to compensate for some moisture leaking out.Here are the steps that I follow:Heat the oven with a baking stone and a tray on the shelf belowBoil the kettlePlace the bread on the baking stonePour a cup of boiling water into the heated trayShut the door as quick as you can - without burning yourself!For more steam or if your oven seal is not great, take these extra steps:Wait 30 seconds then using a spray mister, spray the over walls for 5 secondsShut the door again and wait 30 secondsSpray again for another 5 secondsOpen the door after 20-25 minutes to release the steamAlternative ways (+ photos) to add water to a domestic oven:Put water in the bottom of the ovenHeat a tray in the oven, placed below the baking stone. The tray should have a reasonable lip to hold the water.The tray must also be strong enough to withstand the high heat of a bread oven without wilting, at least 240C (465F). Check the guidelines before you buy.Once you place your bread in the oven, pour a cup (you can use a jug if it’s easier) of tap temperature water onto the hot tray.This will rapidly create steam and so quickly shut the door!You can use boiling water, or ice cubes instead of water from the tap. The boiling water way tends to exhaust the steam so quickly it flies out of the oven- before I can close the door!So I add a bit more if I use boiling or hot water.The ice cube way creates a steady stream of steam, but it can add too much too late on.The issue in adding ice or cold water is it cools the temperature of the oven. Low powered oven users really struggle for their oven to regain temperature when using this method. Baking at a lower temperature will change the texture and colour of the bread.To follow this method, you need space in the oven for the tray, baking stone, and the bread. It also needs to be in a hot area of the oven.Bake with a water bathSimilar to method 1, but we add in more water or ice than in the previous. So much more, that it doesn’t evaporate. To build up the steam, we can put a tray of water in the oven 5-10 minutes before the bread goes in. This gives time for the oven to get back up to temperature before the bread goes in.The tray is removed after 10-15 minutes as the oven spring has occurred and the baking now focuses on the generation of the crust.This is can be great if the seal in your oven is not that great as otherwise the steam tends to escape. I think this is the case for gas ovens as an air circulation is needed to keep the flame going.Letting the heat out the oven when the boiling hot tray is pulled out is desierable to avoid (whilst also trying not to burn yourself with the water).Opening the damperAfter around 20-30 minutes of baking it's best practice to open the oven door quickly to release the steam as a damper does in a professional oven. At this point, the yeast has died from exposure to high temperature. There is to be no more rising so the size of the bread is set. Releasing the moisture lowers the humidity which forces the crust to focus on gelatinization.The spray mister way to make steamUse a spray mister, or if you have a big oven a heavy duty pump action sprayer filled with water. After the bread is dropped spray the inside of the oven with the mister. Be careful to avoid light bulbs, glass and the baking stone, they might shatter.It’s difficult to add enough steam for the best quality bread using this technique.Spraying water 3 times like this (leaving 30-second intervals between each spray) allows the oven to heat up between sprays and gives time for the steam to distribute through the air inside.This method will cool the sides of your oven down quite considerably and also doesn't always create as much steam as the previous two options.Any water mister will do really, though you ideally want one that will throw a lot of water in a short amount of time. A water mister that has a large resvoir and which can pump the water to a high pressure is best. This is the water mister I recommend as it does everything you need to create steam in the oven:Clicking on this link takes you to Amazon where if you decide to purchase I will receive a small commission which helps me to continue making content on this site.Wet the breadDon’t do this:Just don't. You will end up with a gummy crumb, or/and blisters on the surface of the bread. Some bakers looking for the San Francisco bread look choose to wet their hands and smother them over the bread before baking.By all means, have an experiment with this technique but I won’t be recommending it!What does too much steam look like?Below is a photo of the bread where I added water directly to the dough before baking. You can make out some blisters that appear when water is attached to the dough surface when it bakes.The photo also shows the effects of too much steam:The most notable issue of over-steaming the bread is how the cut spreads out. The flour that was on the dough when it came out of the banneton became a paste when it became wet which when baked creates a dull colour. The crust of the over steamed bread has a flat surface, no rise from the cut can be found.What did it taste like?Well it made a nice bread pudding, let's leave it there! If your wondering if you are adding too much water to your oven, look at the picture and see if your bread resembles the same traits.If you are enjoying this guide, please take a moment to follow Busby's Bakery on social media by clicking on the links.

It just takes a second and it really helps my motivation to keep writing more articles.What happens in the oven when we bake bread?Artisan Bread CoachThe ovens role in bread baking is where all your hard work comes to an end. The moment of truth sits in front of you. Before loading your oven you go through the steps you took...“Did I do everything right?...Is the dough proved perfectly? Is it strong enough? The oven, is it hot enough?”After covering the range of methods of creating steam, including my favourite we are now going to cover why it is important, what happens during the baking process and how we can use steam to change many factors of our freshly made bread.The dough being baked may have developed for hours, maybe days. Making a mistake in the final stages is gutting.Getting your bake right creates endless personal satisfaction.You’ll feel able to strive the streets in confidence, pick up new partners in the street, send your food back in restaurants…....Ok, ok, I might have got a bit carried awayBut if your bake goes wrong, you’ll probably wish you hadn’t wasted your time.An introduction to oven springOnce you have the ability to make a great dough you’re going to want to get the most out of your oven. Understanding oven spring is a really important bit of knowledge.A preheated baking stone stores heat from the oven. When bread is placed on the stone the heat is conducted into the bread.To get the best oven spring, we need to add moisture to the environment and use a baking stone.Baking stones emulate the stones found in professional deck ovens by conducting the heat evenly into the base of the bread.Baking stones help the bottom of the bread bake properly and help to create a good oven spring. A good quality baking stone is vital for great quality bread. I scoured hundreds of baking stone reviews and tested a many myself and found that the stones at the lower end of the market do not last very long. They can shatter after a couple of months if you are unlucky.A good baking stone will last a long time and retain heat well enough so you can bake doughs after each other. The baking stone that I use is made from firebrick like the one recommended below. My firebrick baking stone has lasted for a few years, with no sign of damage.See the baking stone I suggest for home bakers(The link takes you to Amazon where I am a affiliate. I you do go ahead and make a purchase I receive a small commision which goes towards keeping the site going)Oven spring explained: As the bread hits the heat of the oven, the dough warms making the active levain work harder (levains love warmth). This reaction forces the bread to rise rapidly.Bread springs up during the first ten minutes of baking. A typical increase is around 20% of the size it was before it entered the oven.We call this “Oven Spring”After approximately ten minutes of exposure to the ovens heat the internal dough temperature hits 60C (140F). This is too hot for the levain and kills its activity, preventing the bread from rising any more.For the remainder of the bake the bread shrinks slowly as moisture escapes.Further reading: How oven spring worksHow important is adding water to an oven to oven spring?When bread dough enters the oven, the outer surface of it is fiercely attacked by the heat. As it’s in direct contact with the hot air of the oven it feels intensity more than the core of the bread.The heat draws the water from the surface of the bread which then evaporates. The elastic gluten at the edges of the bread will bond together (coagulate) as it dehydrates. This creates a crust.A dough with a strong gluten network will create a stronger, more tearable crust than dough that is weak and under fermented.But if the dough’s crust forms shortly after it goes in the oven it will prevent the oven spring from pushing up. The crust is too strong and quick to form, we need to delay it from setting so that the bread will be able to rise in the oven.The crust is essential in bread making, we cannot remove it forms the bread, but if we can delay it setting for 10 minutes so the oven spring can do its thing we can make a nice and light loaf of bread.Adding extra yeast speeds up fermentation time. If you do this you will have to put the bread in the oven at a smaller proof height than usual. The bread will rocket up in the oven which is pretty fun to watch, but you’ll end up with bread with poor flavour and structure.What happens when water is used in the oven?When we add water to the oven the water particles quickly evaporate into the air. They latch onto the air molecules to create the moist gas known as steam.It’s steam that a kettle emits when you make a cup of tea (or whatever you use a kettle for if you live outside the UK), actually thinking about it... Do other countries have kettles??Anyway, I'm sure you get what I mean...Water is retained by the air inside the oven, making it dense. It also means the climate of the oven becomes moist which is another word for humid.As the bread goes into the oven as it is cooler it attracts moisture in the air. The moisture latches to the outside surface area of the dough which creates a barrier between the hot air and the dough.This barrier keeps the dough moist and stops dehydration, allowing oven spring to have full effect. Without adding water to the oven the dough will not spring up very much creating a dense loaf. Oven spring makes the crumb expand which makes it more light and enjoyable.Why increase the oven humidity for bread baking?If you’ve been to a Swedish sauna, you’ll know that adding water to a hot environment intensifies the heat. It’s doesn’t get hotter in the sauna when you add the water, you can check the dial, the thermometer doesn’t go hot desire it feeling more uncomfortable.The water actually cools the temperature, but due to the increase in humidity it feels more intense. Water is a better conductor of heat than air is which combines with the heavy air to make a sauna experience feel more intense.Our bread in the oven undergoes the same exposure once the moisture barrier around it disappears. The oven heat is more intense after the bread has sprung up which makes the crust form harder and thinner.Why starch has a big role in forming the crustIf more water is added to the oven at the start of baking the humidity of the air increases. The increase leads to more moisture being absorbed by the surface of the crust.It’s specifically starch particles that do the absorbing. Starch is a form of sugar that is created by the fermentation of flour.This explains why bread crusts go a darker colour than the interior section of the bread. Similar to how sugar is heated to turn into syrups or caramels which are golden or darker colours.The amount of starch created increases by the amount of fermentation activity the dough undergoes.You may have noticed that supermarket bread has a light, bright, golden coloured crust. The simple colours are due to a short fermentation whereas artisan baked bread usually has a darker, more mature tone.During long bulk fermentation stages, more starch and complex starches are broken down. These create more colour, aroma and flavour intense bread.Learn more about dough fermentation with these two articles:Further reading: Dough fermentation basics

an in depth guide on dough fermentation for bread makingWhat is ""Singing Bread"" & how do crusty loaves get that sheen?Once crusty bread is removed from the oven it crackles rapidly. It’s as if the pops are singing to you! This is called “singing bread”.The cracking noise is actually related to the glazed sheen that you may have noticed appear on crusty bread.So now we know moisture in the oven is absorbed by the starch on the outside of the dough. Though there’s a thing about starch...It has no control limits!Not when comes to absorbing moisture anyway.The starch particles keep absorbing water and growing in size until they finally burst.As these particles burst, they release a gel which coats the outside of the loaf. As the bread continues to bake the gel becomes shinier and hardens.The process continues after the bread is removed from the oven.As the bread cools, moisture escapes from the core of the loaf or what we call the crumb. As it escapes, it goes from the inner core to the outer perimeter before passing out of the crust. The starch at the edge of the loaf latches on to the escaping moisture and continues to grow... and then burst.The bursting starch continues to make the crust shiny and brittle and it’s the bursting starch we hear when it sounds like the bread is signing to us.Can I add too much steam when baking bread?Bread which is not intended to be very crusty usually requires for small amounts of steam when baking. It is also possible to add too much moisture to the oven. You can tell if this has happened as the cuts made in the bread before baking do not open out properly.Overly steamed bread spreads outwards, is less 2D (don’t stick out) and featureless on the crust and has a dense crumb.Should I add steam in every bread I make?If you want your bread to benefit from oven spring fully then yes, but there are breads that you wouldn’t want to do this with. A fantastically common example is soft rolls.Soft rolls should have a dense, soft crumb and a soft top. The opposite of what adding steam provides. Because the cells are more compact from the lack of oven spring the texture of the crumb is soft.The absence of steam also creates a crust that is thicker. This is an important feature of soft bread as a thick crust slows down the rate which moisture can escape from the bread as it cools. The thick crust retains moisture in the crumb making it to be softer to eat.How much steam should I add for laminated doughsLaminated doughs are doughs that contain fats or sweeteners such as butter, eggs or sugar. Brioche is a well known laminated dough containing high quantities of butter, eggs, sugar and milk.This includes, croissants, brioche, and other sweet breads like panettone.In a laminated dough the temperature which starch gelatinizes  s raised by the sweeteners and fats. Adding steam to delay the crust being formed is not required.If you do choose to add steam, it will have little effect on the oven spring. It is more likely to encourage a thicker and harder crust, which can be undesired. That said, adding a little can help hydrate the starch to create a shinier, more attractive bread.With doughs like this, it’s good to start mastering a new recipe without adding steam. Then add it in small quantities in subsequent batches if you feel the recipe would benefit.Not too mad though, otherwise the crust will become too crusty!Gareth Busby""Adding water to the oven alters the texture of the crumb as it creates a thinner crust. Moisture trapped inside the bread after baking escapes easily when cooling making the crumb light and airy.""Do you add steam when making croissants?I do find that adding a little bit of steam helps them spring up and gives croissants and danish pastries a beautiful glazed surface, giving them a wow factor.Too much steam and they’ll be a bit crunchy.Not enough and they will look a little dull and dry.Do you add steam when baking sourdough?If you want your sourdough to have a really thick crust, then yes! Add plenty of steam to the oven at the start of baking. Then drop the temperature after 25 minutes of baking (halfway) from 230c (450F) to around 210c (410F). This will slow the rate in which the starch pops and allow the crust to become nice and hard.If you want a more chewy texture that matches the modern trend of stretch and fold sourdough then I would do it differently.To get a nice spring in the oven I would add some steam, but only a small amount. This will allow a good rise, a nice amount of hydration for the starches, but not too great. Combine this with baking it at a constant 220c (430F) temperature for a more tearable crust.How much water?The amount of water to add in the oven will depend on the type of crust you want on the bread. Adding a small amount is perfect for things like croissants, focaccia or soft ciabattas. It allows them to get a nice soft crumb from the oven spring but doesn’t create too hard of a crust. To make bread with a strong crust typical of sourdough bread or baguettes, add steam in higher quantities. The usual amount is 1 cup.Should you add steam or ice when using a dutch ovenMany bakers bake sourdough bread using dutch ovens. Some preheat the dutch oven before the bread is dropped in and baked, some don’t preheat the dutch oven, and some don’t even preheat the main oven and bake the bread from cold.The idea of using a dutch oven is to create an enclosed space to bake the bread. Cast iron dutch ovens and usually preferred.Having a thick base on the dutch oven generates a good oven spring and as the dutch ovens are good at conducting heat (especially the cast iron ones), the heat quickly seeps inside, locking any moisture from escape which creates an intense environment to bake bread.Having a decent sealed lid on a dutch oven should retain enough moisture. No additional steam should be required to make a decent loaf of bread. Some bakers that don’t have a very powerful oven or tend to underproof their bread like to create additional steam.They either spray the bread (remember method 4 - avoid at all costs!) which will help but will create blisters and an uneven colour/texture. Or they chuck a few ice cubes in the base to the side of the bread as it goes in, providing you have enough space in your dutch oven.Some will bake the bread on a layer of parchment paper, making a barrier between the dough and the dutch oven bottom.If you find the amount of steam a problem I would first review the dough quality, checking it is well developed and the water ratio is healthy for the flour before using one of these methods to add more steam.How much oven spring will I get with different flours?Well developed and well final proved breads will get a lot less spring than an underdeveloped dough.Wholemeal flour is more complex to break down so expect less oven spring, this goes for many complex grains.Low gluten flours and grains will not have the elasticity to spring far in the oven which is why these breads are often dense.Rye bread requires plenty of steam in the oven to keep the crust together which prevents it from cracking.To concludeSo, in reality, the amount of oven spring depends on the type of flour used, how well it has fermented, the heat of the oven, the amount of levain and the amount of steam.The biggest challenge you will have is mastering how your oven reacts to your choice of steam, does it retain it well?... does it cool down too much?Experimenting a little till you get a method that works well for you may take a few attempts but believe me it is worth it when you get it right!All in all, having a trusted method of adding water to the oven and so creating steam is vital for every home or professional baker.For crusty, light and airy bread  - add steamIs there anything I have missed or a topic that I have not been clear on?
