This delicious classic Italian ring cake is simple, fast and butter-free.
By Elisa Gennari

Basically every person I know used to have, as a child, what we call “ciambellone” (big doughnut). I don’t think in the 70s and 80s in Italy there were women who did not know how to bake this delicious cake (obviously every household had its own recipe..).
Unfortunately, for the last two decades many moms seem to have forgotten how to bake their children an healthy and home made snack and had replaced it with ready-made ones, rich in sugars and preservatives. Recently, though, there has been a change of direction and many mothers are becoming more aware of the importance of food habits in children, and have started again to bake their own cakes.

You don’t have to be and expert chef to cook this simple cake and it’s amazing to prepare it with the kids. It’s so easy they can make it on their own. It tastes like old days, it is the perfect comfort food. Can you find something more simple?
I remember when I was a little girl my mom used to bake this cake and many variations of it, quite twice a week to make me and my sister have a healthy snack in the afternoon. Nowadays I would also say that it’s not only healthy for your children but it also really cheap, you will need just 5 simple ingredients. You can also add your personal twist by adding raisins, chocolate chips, nuts or everything you like, I’ve made it a couple of times with matcha green tea, it was awesome. I recommend you try it with chocolate chips and pecan or with a mix of grounded spices such as ginger, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves…it will always be perfect.
To get the original shape you will need a ring-shaped pan, but if you don’t have it you can use a plumcake pan or a 23cm round pan.
Some tips to make some changes to this cake:
1. Richer taste: You can substitute milk with yogurt, or cream if you want to prepare a richer cake.
2. To make a marble cake: you use 250gr of all purpose flour, then divide the batter into two bowls and add 50 gr of cocoa powder into one. Then pour the dough into the pan alternately.
3. Apple variation: slice two apples and line them over the batter in the pan, dust with caster sugar and bake.
4. Whole grain variation: use whole grain flour – spelt, oat, wheat or a mix
5. Dairy free: use soy milk instead of regular milk
Now let’s bake our cake!

Listen to this: My editor at Bazaar took me out to lunch before the holidays and congratulated me for eating the bread out of the bread basket that was placed on the table while we waited for our meal. (The chewy, delicious bread, I might add, though I would have eaten it even if it hadn't been good, because I am a human and it was lunchtime and I was hungry.)
She.
Congratulated.
Me.
She ate the bread, too, mind. It's just that she's the only person she knows - besides me now, I guess - who still actually eats bread. And pasta. And springs for two courses on a business lunch. Sigh.
You all know I like a good New Year's resolution as much as the next person. I'm all about fresh starts and good intentions, I really am. Why, just the other day I ordered a ginger-apple-carrot juice with breakfast myself! But when congratulations are offered on eating a piece of bread, for the love of Pete, I feel like this whole cleanse/no-carb/juice/detox mania has officially reached crazy-making levels. (Exhibit A: Elevating Adaptogenic Latte. What?) And while I'm at it: can we once and for all get rid of the term ""clean eating""? It makes my head hurt.
So, in light of all of this, I've decided to post a second recipe for cake in one week. I feel like it's my civic duty or something.
Without further ado: Ciambellone! (chahm-bell-ohn-eh) Also known as the only cake my mother knows how to make. (More or less.)
Ciambellone is a sunny, simple tube cake made with yogurt and lemon peel. It's tender and fragrant, has a good, sensible crumb, lasts for a few days on the kitchen counter, is not-too-sweet, easy to make, and very nice for breakfast (with a glass of green juice or without). It's also good at teatime and as a snack for little children. In other words, it's a perfect everyday cake.
(Other perfect everyday cakes: Catherine Newman's Donut Cake, Deborah Madison's Poppyseed Cake and Alice Medrich's Kamut Pound Cake, all of which I adore passionately and do not make nearly enough. I blame that thing I'm working on. On my to-make-soon list, though, is Molly's whole-wheat riff on an Edna Lewis cake, which looks right up my alley. Consider it my New Year's resolution!)
I suspect you will be relieved to know that ciambellone does not require confectioners' sugar on top or an icing of any kind or new-fangled additions to the batter. It is simplicity itself, wholesomeness incarnate. But most of all, it's just a happy-making little thing. Which makes it just right for gray, old January. Or any other month out of the year.
Three cheers for cake!

If you have access to that, use it - it's lovely - and leave out the vanilla extract and baking powder below. If you don't have access to Pane degli Angeli, follow the recipe below.
3/4 cup minus 1 tablespoon (150 grams) sugar2 large eggs3.5 ounces/7 tablespoons (100 grams) unsalted butter, melted1/2 cup (125 grams) plain whole-milk yogurt1 teaspoon vanilla extractGrated peel of 1/2 organic lemon1 2/3 cup (200 grams) all-purpose flour2 teaspoons baking powder
1. Heat the oven to 350 F/180 C. Butter a tube pan.
2. Place the sugar, eggs, melted butter, yogurt, vanilla extract, and grated lemon peel in a bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Then slowly beat in the flour. Finally, beat in the baking powder. Scrape the batter immediately into the prepared cake pan, even the top and bake for 30 minutes, until a rich golden-brown.
3. Let the cake cool on a rack for 15 minutes, then turn the pan upside-down and unmold the cake. Let cool completely before serving. Loosely covered with plastic wrap, the cake will keep at room temperature for 3 days.

If you want to Be Italian For A Weekend, you can join the Vespa ride and get a three-day email crash course about Italian culture! 

It’s the middle of a February afternoon and it’s snowing outside. 
I’m sitting in my office doing some work and suddenly my mind goes back to my childhood. It does not snow very often in the place where I live – maybe once or twice a year, and when it does, it’s quite an event: People go outside, shovel the lawns, talk to each other, and dogs bark happily diving into heaps of white snow. We all feel like children again.

That’s the magic of snow: it makes us all children again, if only for just a moment.
This takes me back to a time when I am probably six or seven years old and I’ve just finished my homework. It’s four in the afternoon and time for merenda, the traditional Italian mid-afternoon snack. I am allowed to grab a Topolino (the Italian for Mickey Mouse) comic, sit on the couch and wait for my mother to prepare my favorite snack – bread and Nutella. Two slices of thick bread, two fat spoons of Nutella and I am ready for my ten minutes of heaven, while reading Donald Duck and Rockerduck.
But my mother has changed her mind. She has decided that Nutella is not healthy. She says that it is too fat and can’t be eaten every day. What? Are you crazy? What am I supposed to eat instead? A nice and healthy cake. When you are a kid, you really don’t give a damn about healthy food, right? You want it to be yummy, mouth-watering, and sweet. Now, I have to eat a healthy cake. It tastes of nothing. But here it is, much better than bread and olive oil, which my mother tried to convince me to bring to school one day. Or bread, butter, and sugar (one of the best things on earth, as I was later to discover), another of my mother’s beloved snacks.
After that first shocking moment, I grew to like this simple yet tasty cake, which comes to my mind every time I need some comfort food. In days like today, with the snow outside and the fire roaring by my desk, I feel the need to bake this cake and be a little kid again, for a while.
So I would like to share this recipe with you because it’s super easy to bake, is ready in a minute, and is a great healthy snack (moms are always right, I know).
Ciambellone classico
Ciambellone is a ring-shaped cake, similar to a plum-cake in its ingredients and taste. The one I am writing below is the basic recipe, which can be customized by adding other ingredients, like chocolate, nuts, pine nuts and whatever comes to mind. I usually make it as simple as possible, exactly as my mother used to do. I usually use a Kitchen Aid mixer for this kind of cakes, but my mother used to hand mix everything, so it is perfectly doable even if you do not own a food processor.
Ingredients
2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
2/3 cup sugar
3 eggs
1/3 cup olive oil
1/3 cup milk
1 lemon (you’ll just need the lemon zest)
1 packet baking powder
Blend the eggs with the sugar until they are nice and creamy. Slowly add milk, then oil, and then the lemon zest. Add the flour, little by little, making sure that it does not form lumps and then add the baking powder. Carefully and generously butter a ring cake pan and transfer the batter in the pan. Bake it at 375° for 40 minutes. Let the cake cool and place it on a serving plate. Dust the cake nicely with icing sugar and enjoy it!

It’s always been my (Sarah’s) dream to learn to cook from an Italian grandmother. Fortunately I’ve had two opportunities to do that in the past few years. Once, in Mamma Agata’s kitchen in Ravello (read about it here) and before that, at our friends’ house in Bologna.
We visited friends of ours who live in Bologna and had previously told them about our interest in learning to cook authentic Italian food from a wise old Italian nonna. They had just the right person in mind, and invited over a woman they had met through living in Bologna for several years.

Lucia had moved to Bologna from Naples, so her repertoire of go-to recipes was mostly Neapolitan. We had such a fun time cooking, practicing our Italian, and learning recipes that Lucia would make for her own family at home.
Ciambella is an Italian bundt cake. We’ve seen many recipes for it (they vary by region), but this one combines chocolate and vanilla in one delicious cake. You will need a packet of Italian vanilla leavening. You can either use Bertolini if you can find it at a local market , or just order a pack of Paneangeli. They’re really inexpensive and then you can whip up a ciambella whenever you want.
You’ll also need a bundt pan. Ours is a really simple one with straight edges, but you can definitely use something more ornate. This fluted one and this swirl one are especially nice. A non-stick one is preferable.
Since Lucia is from Naples, we thought it was only fitting to serve ours on a beautiful southern Italian platter. We also love this blue and white platter, this silver glass cake stand, and this silver cake server.
We’ll be sending out an exclusive email to our insider’s list with all the recipes from our day with Lucia. If you love Italian food, make sure to sign up so you don’t miss out!

   Print  Ciambella    Author: Lucia         Ingredients  300 g sugar 3 eggs, separated 150 g butter, soft plus more for pan 300 g flour 1 packet vanilla leavening 1 c milk 30 g of unsweetened cocoa powder salt     Instructions  Butter and flour a bunt pan. In a bowl, mix the egg whites, salt, and 3 teaspoons of water and beat until you have peaks. In another bowl, combine the yolks and sugar. Add softened butter and combine. Next, add flour, vanilla packet, and ½ cup of milk a little at a time. Combine with the egg white mixture. Add the rest of the milk and combine well. Using only half of the batter, put four large spoonfuls into the prepared cake pan so that there is a space between each dollop of batter (like points on a compass). Add cocoa powder to remaining half of the batter. Mix well and fill the open spaces in the pan with the chocolate batter. This should give you an alternating vanilla/chocolate pattern. Take a knife and cut from the chocolate into the plain batter twice on each side to merge the two flavors. Bake at 300F for 30 minutes or until the knife comes out clean.    3.5.3208

Aniseed Ring Cake: Ciambellone

PreviousNext12

In Le Marche I have noticed that many families buy their cakes from their local pasticceria (cake shop) rather than make them at home but this traditional cake is the one every household used to make weekly as a mid afternoon snack, as an accompaniment to their after dinner digestivo or for breakfast with a cappuccino.
The secret ingredients in this cake are the mistra and a handful of aniseeds. Mistra is a Le Marche liqueur made with aniseed and at the end of one of Fabio’s fabulous meals you must try a glass! The addition of mistra gives the finished ciambellone cake a delicate and aromatic aniseedy flavour. It is not at all overpowering and as the recipe uses olive oil instead of butter, it is fairly healthy as cakes go!
The basic recipe can be adapted by adding raisins, or maybe replacing the mistra with more lemon zest and lemon juice
 


 
Ingredients:
500g plain flour 00
3 eggs
150g sugar
200ml milk
100ml olive oil
180ml mistra
zest from one lemon
15g baking powder
handful of aniseeds
chopped almonds to decorate
 
Method:
In a large bowl mix the eggs, sugar, milk and oil, ideally with an electric mixer or by hand.
Add the mistra and lemon zest and stir into the mixture.
Carefully mix in the flour and the baking powder until combined.
Also mix in the aniseeds.
Decorate the top with chopped almonds and a sprinkle of sugar.
Scrape the cake batter into a ring form tin, oiled and floured.
Bake at 180 degrees centigrade for approx 1/2 hour or until lightly golden.

25,http://www.anitaliancanadianlife.ca/recipes/ciambelle-with-fennel,"All Food February continues on An Italian-Canadian Life with one of my favourite breads to have in the house: ciambelle with fennel!Ciambella (or chiambella) is a word used for pretty much anything round with a hole in the middle really, even cakes appear with this name. However, this is a bread that is a crunchy-on-the-outside, chewy-in-the-middle, great-for-dipping-or-with-cheese kind of bread that I always like to have in the house. My mother started making this bread after getting the recipe from a friend and it’s become one of my family favourites. I believe she’s perfected getting the outside crispy. It freezes very well, so they are easy to keep and then warm up in the oven to have with dinner or appetizers.Besides just being awesome bread, I now expect it for any family gathering, it’s just part of tradition. But my favourite memory with this bread happened just last year. My husband and I served it for the first time to his grandfather. His Nonno immediately began to tear up. Turns out, his sister (since passed) used to make this bread for him all the time and he hadn’t had it since he was quite young. It brought back all sorts of memories for him. For Christmas, we baked up a double batch and brought him a huge basket full to store in his freezer and have whenever he wanted. He was thrilled and still talks about it. Best. Christmas. Present. Ever. That’s an old recipe come to life.Ciambelle with Fennel 12 cups of all-purpose flour 4 large eggs 1/2 cup vegetable oil 2 tablespoons salt 1 tablespoon fennel seeds 2 tablespoons of dry active yeast 1 teaspoon sugar 3 cups warm waterMix together the water, sugar and yeast and let it activate. Meanwhile, in a large bowl mix together the flour, salt and fennel. Once the yeast is ready, mix it together with the eggs and oil.You can create the dough by hand or in a large mixture. To do it by hand, on a wooden board, make a mound with the flour mixture and create a well in the middle. Into the well add in the egg mixture and begin to incorporate it into the flour using a fork, working around the edge of the well. As it comes together, knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic.If you are using a large mixer, put the flour into the bowl and add the egg mixture to it. Using a dough hook, mix the ingredients together. Continue to knead it until the dough is smooth and elastic and not sticky at all.Place the dough in a bowl and cover it with plastic wrap and a towel. Allow it to rise until it doubles in size. Once the dough has risen, it’s time to prep for the second part of the process. Put a large pot of water on to boil and preheat your oven to 400 degrees.Turn out the dough onto a well-floured wooden board. Cut off portions of the dough to work with immediately and cover the rest, in reserve, while you are working. Roll out your dough to create a rope about 18 inches long and 1 inch thick. Be sure to slightly flour your hands before doing this and use your palms to roll. When you have your rope length, use one hand to hold one end still while using your other palm to roll the rest of the rope creating a slight twist in the dough. Bring the two ends together and join them to form a large doughnut shape. You’ll need to press the ends together and roll them slightly with your palm.It’s important that you do not allow the dough to rise again, so create six or seven ciambelle to work with to start. When you have your ciambelle, drop one (or two if the pot is very large) into the boiling pot of water. They should rise to the top immediately. When they rise, turn them over and let it boil for one minute. Remove and drain on a dish towel. Repeat with the remaining ciambelle. This process is what give the ciambelle their shiny crust.When all six have been boiled, place the ciambelle directly on your oven grates and bake in the top third of the oven. Bake for about 10-12 minutes on each side, for a total of 20-22 minutes or until a medium golden. In a convection oven, where the element is not exposed, cook them on the middle rack. Enjoy them while they are hot, or freeze and reheat in the oven later.",ciambellone

Apple desserts in their various versions are so warm and comforting. This version: the apple ring cake or the apple ciambella gives you that much needed hug — it envelopes your senses with all that apple goodness, holds you tight with its fresh flavour and lush aroma, lifts you and promises to not let go.
It’s Italian, you see. Bene, no? A ciambella is an Italian bundt cake that varies from region to region. They’re made with olive oil (like most Italian cakes) the zest of a lemon or orange and buttermilk, along with the usual cake ingredients. Ciambelle are usually served as an afternoon snack at a bar or caffé.







This classic decadent Italian dessert is brought to you straight out of Ritu Dalmia’s Italian Khana: Desserts. A master Italian chef, this lady knows her ciambelle well. She shares a recipe that’s usually only passed down to younger folks in a family, that was shared by a friend.
Oil does not adversely affect the taste of your cakes and locks in a lot of moisture. Not at all what you’d expect of oil, right? Read this article on how different fats affect cakes if you’ve always used butter and are skeptical about using oil. And while we’re on the subject of oil, you might want to consider making these oil based cakes: the epic vegan chocolate cake, and the ultimate carrot cake — you’ll be pleasantly surprised!
This rich, moist apple ring cake smells so fresh, and is full of flavour and texture. It’s surprisingly simple to make, except for when you have to slice the apples, and beat the eggs and sugar together. Otherwise you’re only going to fold the ingredients in together before you put it in the oven.
Okay then, I have to rush — I need another hug!

In America, we have a tendency to eat savory breakfasts. At least that was always my go-to. You know, eggs and bacon, omelets, egg and cheese on a roll… (Pardon me as I drool…) In Italy however, they seem to like a sweet breakfast. Toast with jam, biscotti, chocolate-filled pastries, donuts filled with pastry cream, or this Ciambella allo Yogurt agli Agrumi. A ciambella is a ring cake, similar to a bundt cake, and you see them all over Italy in a variety of flavors. Like a bundt cake, they are incredibly homey and easy to make. This Ciambella allo Yogurt agli Agrumi is a delightful and light cake made with yogurt and a hint of citrus. It’s moist, not too sweet and simple to whip up. It’s perfect for your morning or afternoon coffee!

I had this cake while traveling to Puglia almost 5 years ago. We stayed in an idyllic agriturismo (working farm) near a town called Locorotondo, at a place called the Masseria Aprile Agriturismo. This place was glorious – charming, peaceful, quiet, and beautiful. They had gardens with heavenly produce, animals, and an amazing staff. Every morning the owner, Anna, made a wonderful breakfast with fresh breads and cakes. This Ciambella allo Yogurt agli Agrumi was one of them. She very kindly shared the recipe with me, and now I’m sharing it with you. If you find your way to that area of Puglia, I can’t recommend her farm enough. Some of the rooms have outdoor kitchens and dining spaces in which to lounge over a great meal in a picturesque setting. I wish I could be there right now!
Notes on the recipe
As I said, this Ciambella allo Yogurt recipe is incredibly easy. You don’t need anything other than a kitchen scale that can weigh grams (most electronic scales measure both ounces and grams), and two bowls. It doesn’t get simpler. Even though many of you reading this will be in America where it is not customary to weigh ingredients for baking, I am keeping this recipe in its original form. It works and, frankly, weighing for pastry recipes is better and more accurate whether you are using grams or ounces. Scales are so cheap nowadays that there is really no reason to not have one. They help in baking, scaling recipes, and with portion control. I use mine every day. To use a scale, carefully measure one ingredient, tare off to zero and proceed with the next ingredient, tare off, and continue. A scale means fewer dishes, so, yay!

For this cake, I used a 24-cm/9-inch ciambella/ring pan.  If you don’t have one, use a regular bundt pan. In addition, I’ve included an ingredient list for making the recipe in Italy and provided substitutions for those of you outside of Italy. For instance, in Italy, I use the Yomo brand of yogurt flavored with Sicilian citrus called Agrumi di Sicilia which provides the citrus flavor, along with orange and lemon zest. For those of you that can’t get it, I’ve provided a way to mimic the flavor of that yogurt. Also, in Italy, it’s common to leaven cakes with something called Lievito per Dolci, that’s flavored with vanilla. You can substitute with baking powder and add vanilla extract. The amounts are below. 
Now to the recipe. Happy baking!

Sometimes I stray across a recipe that I'm moved to make straight away. Such was the case last week when the ever-reliable Smitten Kitchen published a recipe for an Italian tea cake I'd never heard of called ciambellone. I have no idea really how to pronounce this but in my head it sounds like cymbals being smashed together as in look and taste that's its effect. Further cause for celebration - it's a one bowl affair, oil-based (so no melting or creaming of butter) and I had almost all of the ingredients already, including (as a bonus) eggs from my Dad's chooks he'd brought with him in his carry-on luggage for a weekend visit. We'd planned a drive and no road trip is complete without a thermos and a treat to have with it. We had ours at a point in a park looking out at endless water. And again, back at home, for afternoon tea. 







Ciambellone (Italian tea cake)

Adapted from a recipe by Smitten Kitchen




2 1/2 teaspoons seems like A LOT of salt but don't be deterred - it balances the sugar perfectly. Speaking of sugar - this was the first time I've tried the technique of coating the greased tin in sugar rather than flour - I was skeptical but it worked perfectly and provided a nice clean surface for the icing. If you don't have a bundt tin, you could scale down the quantities below and make it in a loaf tin or a regular round cake tin I'm sure. 





2 cups (400g) granulated sugar
2 1/2 teaspoons fine sea or table salt
Finely grated zest of 1 lemon
Finely grated zest of half an orange
1 1/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons (325ml) neutral oil - such as sunflower, safflower, grapeseed or another vegetable oil (I used grapeseed)
3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon (about 185g) plain, not Greek, yogurt (or 3/4 cup Greek yoghurt plus one tablespoon water)
1/2 cup (120g) mascarpone
1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon (20ml) vanilla extract
4 large eggs
3 cups (390g) all-purpose flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 

Icing 

1 cup (120g) icing sugar
About 3 tablespoons (45ml) freshly squeezed lemon juice





Preheat oven to 375 deg F. Grease bundt tin with butter and dust with granulated 
sugar. Knock out any excess sugar from tin. 



Place sugar and salt in a large bowl and rub the zest into it with your fingertips. Add in oil, mascarpone, yogurt, and then eggs and 
vanilla and whisk until smooth. Sprinkle baking powder over batter and whisk to incorporate. Fold in sifted flour.




Pour batter into tin, smooth out evenly, then tap tin on counter a few times to remove any air bubbles. Bake for about 40 minutes, checking in at the 30 minute mark to rotate the tin for 
even colouring, and to ensure it’s not baking faster than anticipated. 
Cake is done when a toothpick or skewer inserted in centre comes out cleanly. 

While the cake is baking, make the icing: Mix icing sugar with 2 tablespoons of the lemon juice until smooth, 
adding the last tablespoon of juice just if needed but don't thin out too much - you want this mixture thick so it will stick to the sides of the cake. 


When cake is done, let it rest on a cooling rack for 3 to 5 minutes, 
then remove it from the tin while hot. Pour icing evenly 
over the top of the cake, letting it run down the sides.

Ciambella Mandorlata is an Italian Easter bread that is shaped like a ring and coated with a cinnamon sugar and sliced almond glaze. 







This Ciambella Mandorlata is a wonderful breakfast bread. It's enriched with eggs and butter, and very similar to a sweetened brioche bread.

The cinnamon sugar almond coating adds a wonderful nutty crunch to the crust too.

This bread is wonderful for breakfast spread with marmalade or jam. Serve it with coffee (and maybe mimosas) for a tasty treat.





A ciambella is a ring cake. In fact, if you drop ""ciambella"" into Google Translate, you get ""donut.""


How to shape ciambella mandorlata: 

You divide dough for this bread into two pieces and roll it into long ropes. Next, you twist the ropes around each other and then join the ends together to form a ring.

If you want your ring to have a hole in the middle, make sure that the ropes you form are pretty long (about 20 inches), because the hole will otherwise close when the dough rises. You could also bake the loaf in a ring pan or place an oven proof custard cup in the middle to prevent the ""doughnut hole"" from closing.

I chose to make a fat ring with 16 inch ropes, even though I knew the middle would come together. It reminds me of my Demerara Sugar Challah and this Sourdough Golden Beet Braided Bread.




This month, the Bread Baking Babes are making Ciambella Mandorlata. Our host is Aparna of My Diverse Kitchen.

The dough for this recipe makes a pretty large loaf. While the deflated dough looks pretty small, it definitely has great oven spring. With all of the sugar, eggs, and butter in the dough, the rising time will be pretty slow, so don't worry too much if the dough takes its own sweet time to rise.

I was a little worried that my bread was over proofing, but I shouldn't have. The crumb in this loaf was still pretty dense in parts... and maybe could have used a bit more time.

My favorite part of this bread was the cinnamon almond egg mixture. You whisk together an egg with cinnamon sugar and some sliced almonds and spread the mixture over the bread with an offset spatula. The almonds get all toasty and the mixture gets all crispy. So good.




Be sure to pay close attention to the bread as it is baking. There is a lot of sugar in the topping, which could cause the loaf to burn while baking. If it begins to get too dark, tent the loaf with foil to prevent the loaf from burning.

This bread is best the day that it is made. Slice and freeze any leftovers to preserve for toasting later. Leftovers of this bread are also excellent for bread pudding or French toast. In fact, you can make some French toast, cool it, wrap each piece individually, and freeze it to toast later.

Author: Karen Kerr


Ciambella Mandorlata is an Italian Easter bread that originated in Bologna in the Emilia Romagna region.


ingredients:


For the Dough

2 teaspoons instant yeast
1/2 cup lukewarm milk
19 1/8 ounces (542 grams/4 1/2 cups bread flour
2 teaspoons salt
1/3 cup sugar
Zest of three lemons
9 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
3 eggs, beaten

I will delight adults and children. Try me once and we will be friends forever.
Remember the ciambellone al limone? The soft, moist cake so many of you made and loved? Well, ciambellone marmorizzato is on the same scale of goodness – but if you are a chocolate lover, this cake is a must for you! Easy and quick to make, it is beautiful to look at with its white and brown swirls.

GO TO RECIPE


So if you want to surprise and impress your friends (in a world where everyone has become pretty cynical about everything, it is a tough challenge, but worth a try!) at a relaxed afternoon tea at your place, or want to spoil your children or partner with something special to have for breakfast (yes yes: for breakfast!), ciambellone marmorizzato should be added to your list of “easy, quick and fantabulous baking recipes”.
I remember this cake from birthday parties I went to when I was younger. Often placed at the
centre of a busy buffet table, the ciambellone marmorizzato was always a major attraction for us children. I always wondered what kind of magic people were doing to get that bicolour cake.
Magic…?
And then one day, a couple of years ago, I asked my mum to share the recipe of the “magic ciambellone“… and when I made it the magic was over: it turns out there’s no magic in there! Just a bit of separating and mixing and done! But although it is no longer a mysterious cake, for me it will always have a bit of magic attached to it. 🙂 How amazing it is to be children?!
And in a way it is truly magic, because it makes people smile a lot when they see it. George, for instance, looked like a child who had seen a big aeroplane or something really exciting. Eyes wide open and a smile from one ear to the other. It was a real delight to see such a surprised expression on his gorgeous face.
Ingredients for ciambellone marmorizzato
Serves  8 – 10

3 medium-sized eggs
250g caster sugar
100ml sunflower oil
250ml full fat milk (semi-skimmed is okay, too)
250g self-raising flour
1 teaspoon of baking powder
3 drops of vanilla essence
2 or 3 tablespoons cocoa powder

Extra

Butter and extra flour to line a ring-shaped cake tin of 24cm (the one I use has the base smaller than the top, so if you use a regular one you could use a slightly smaller one of 22cm)
Icing sugar for dusting

Method
Line the ciambellone tin with some butter and dust it lightly with flour. Preheat the oven to 180°C (160°C fan)
In a large bowl whip the eggs and sugar with a mixer for a few minutes until they are well incorporated and you obtain a pale and smooth mixture.
Add the milk, the oil and vanilla essence and mix well.
Sift the self-raising flour, add the baking powder and pour them into the bowl with the rest of the mixture. Mix well (using a mixer), until you obtain a smooth and compact mixture.
Out of this mixture, pour about 300ml into a bowl. Add 2 or even 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder and mix well until you obtain a lump-free mixture and the content is evenly dark/brown.
Pour the “white” mixture into the ciambellone tin. Pour the chocolate based mixture all over the top, distributing it evenly across the top. Some of it will automatically sink to the bottom. Some will stay on the surface.
Just like marble… Or not?!
With a fork twist the dark mixture as to create swirls. It doesn’t have to be exact – it is just to add a twist of colour to the surface.
Swirls, beautiful swirls
Place the tin in the oven for about 40 minutes (depending on your oven, it might take up to 45 or even 50 minutes) until the ciambellone has risen well and is firm to the touch.
If the wooden stick comes out clean, turn the oven off, open the door and leave the cake for another 5 minutes before taking it out. Leave it to cool in the tin.
Once cooled, take it out of the tin and move it to a serving plate.
Before….and after:-D
Sprinkle with icing sugar and enjoy with a cup of tea or, as Italians would do, with an espresso or cappuccino for breakfast!
Stop staring… Just eat me!
This ciambellone is also perfect for children accompanied by a nice glass of milk. That’s what I used to do when I was a little girl. Erm, well, clearly I am still a little girl…!
If stored well, this ciambellone marmorizzato will keep well for up to three days, but I can assure you that it won’t last that long 😛

I mentioned this past Sunday that I am planning a trip to Italy this fall, so naturally I am a wee bit obsessed with all things Italian at the moment. I am a big-time planner: I have been spending copious amounts of time searching for the best flights, reading reviews of bed & breakfasts, and (obviously) checking out restaurant menus in preparation for our journey. We are definitely the type of travellers that like to know where we are going to sleep every night in advance. We’re not spontaneous, “let’s just see what happens when we get there” people!
However, I am not one of those people who needs to painstakingly plan out each day from sunrise to sunset. In fact, I rarely wear a watch while I am travelling. Aside from knowing where I’m going to lay my head, I don’t like to restrict myself too much. What about you, reader? Are you an itinerary person, or more of a free-spirited traveller?

It should go without saying that I am very much looking forward to the food in Italy, as I absolutely I love Italian cooking and baking. Today, I’ve taken a recipe for Ciambellone (cham-bell-OH-nay), a traditional Italian coffee cake, and added Amaretto and orange zest to the mixture, making the batter smell (and taste) like a creamsicle. Finally, because I was feeling a bit decadent, I brushed the entire finished cake in a delectable Amaretto simple syrup.

The batter is a cinch to throw together, as you basically blitz everything together in a food processor. Once baked, the finished cake has  lovely dense texture, somewhere between a regular cake and a pound cake, and a cheerful golden yellow crust and crumb. The flavours of Amaretto, orange and vanilla mellow out while the cake bakes, and the Amaretto simple syrup lends a sweet, slightly boozy note to the finished product.The end result is not overly sweet, so you could probably get away with frosting it – chocolate or Nutella frosting might be delicious – or finishing it with a simple dusting of powdered sugar.

I prefer it as-is, because slices of this cake are absolutely perfect for dunking into a cup of coffee, which makes me sublimely happy. Other dunking options include tea, hot chocolate, or a cold glass of milk. I’ve also been having a slice with some mixed fruit or berries for breakfast. However you prefer it, buon appetito!

  Ciambellone with Amaretto Simple Syrup     Print     Prep time  15 mins    Cook time  45 mins    Total time  1 hour       Serves: 12   Ingredients For the Ciambellone:  2 and ½ cups all-purpose flour ½ cup almond flour 1 and ½ cups sugar 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoons baking soda ⅛ teaspoon coarse salt ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into ½-inch pieces 3 large eggs, lightly beaten ¼ cup half-and-half or light cream 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 teaspoon almond extract 2 tablespoons Amaretto liqueur 1 teaspoon grated orange zest  For the Amaretto Simple Syrup:  ½ cup sugar ¼ cup Amaretto liqueur 1 cup water     Directions Make the Ciambellone:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour a 9-inch tube or bundt pan and set aside. In a food processor, combine the flour, almond flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt; pulse briefly to combine. Distribute the butter around the bowl and process briefly until the butter is incorporated. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, cream, vanilla and almond extracts, 2 tablespoons Amaretto, and orange zest. With the food processor running, pour the liquid mixture through the feed tube and process until everything is well blended and a thick and sticky batter has formed. With a spatula, scoop the batter into the prepared pan and spread it around evenly. Note: It is a very thick, dough-like batter! Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown and a cake tester inserted into the centre comes out clean, about 35-45 minutes. Let cool in the pan on a wire rack for 20-30 minutes.  Make the Amaretto Simple Syrup:  In a small saucepan, combine the sugar, ¼ cup Amaretto and 1 cup water. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is smooth. Brush the syrup in an even layer over the bottom of the baked cake. Turn the cake out of the pan and brush an even layer of the syrup over the entire surface. Let cool completely on the wire rack. For a more pronounced Amaretto flavour, brush another layer of syrup over the surface. Best served the day it's made, but the cake will keep for a day or two tightly wrapped at room temperature.    3.2.1263

Prepare this delicious Ciambellone at home in just a few steps and enjoy it in the morning with a foamy cappuccino. The recipe is very simple and in a few minutes you will be enjoying an aromatic italian cake that tastes exactly like nonna’s!
Make me a cake, please…
Every now and then Max (my husband) asks me to bake him un semplice ciambellone per il cappuccino, per favore, amore… … And well, I can’t say no because I love to indulge my family with their favorite treats. 
So I make his mom’s ciambellone because is a recipe that has never failed and is so easy to make. Every time I bake this, the house will fill with this wonderful fragrance of baking goods and in less than one hour we will be enjoying this wonderful cake still warm from the oven.

What is Ciambellone?
Ciambellone is a very common Italian breakfast cake served in the morning to accompany the traditional cappuccino or to have it as an afternoon snack.
 It is a soft and fluffy sweet cake, with a rich aroma of citrus and vanilla and shaped like a big donut. Is not so buttery but moist enough to enjoy it alone.
In Italy it is prepared in many ways, there is ciambellone with chocolate, vanilla or a combination of both (marmorizzato). 
The recipes are also very varied, for example with or without butter, gluten-free, without eggs, with water or milk, or as in this case, yogurt, which is the one we like the most at home.
Is ciambellone a dessert?
It can be, yes. Even though this cake is eaten mostly as breakfast or sometimes as a snack; it can also be serve as a dessert. 
I like to serve it with a caramel or chocolate sauce or also with a scoop of mascarpone gelato on top of a slice. People love it this way!

How to store
You can store the cake in a container with a lid and leave it at room temperature for 4-5 days maximum.As many cakes, don’t leave it without covering properly or it will dry and become hard.You can also wrap it with cling film, this is my favourite way for storing ciambellone because keeps it very soft.If you want to freeze it you can do it; just cut the cake into small portions, then wrap them tightly with cling film.
Ingredients for Ciambellone Cake
FLOUR – All purpose flour is what we use. You can also use cake flour, just make sure to add one teaspoon less of baking powder.
SUGAR – White sugar or any other sugar you prefer. Sometimes I make it with brown sugar and it turns wonderful, a little bit more brown but still so good.
EGGS – I used 3 mediums eggs which weight in total about 220gr. If you using small eggs I recommend adding four instead. 
YOGURT –  Use plain yogurt with no sugar. Or if you don’t have that just use normal yogurt, even with fruit. the taste will change sightly but it will be still delicious. 
OIL – I used canola oil because it has a neutral flavour, but actually my MiL uses extravirgin olive oil and the cake comes out amazing! 
AROMAS – Lemon zest and vanilla extract are the obvious choices, but ciambellone can also be flavoured with orange zest, almond extract, rum, etc.
RAISING – Baking powder, baking soda and salt.

Cimbellone Recipe
Grease and flour a ring-shaped pan (read notes. Heat the oven at 180 °C (350F).
Put the eggs into a mixer bowl, add the salt and beat for 1 minute on medium speed. Add the sugar and beat on high speed for 5 minutes.
Add the lemon zest and vanilla extract, continue beating on high speed until you get a fluffy, light yellow mixture (see video). Add the oil and the yogurt, mix for a few seconds at medium speed so that the ingredients are integrated.
Place a strainer over the bowl, add the flour, baking powder and baking soda, sift well.  Mix for a few seconds, it does not matter that there are a couple of lumps left as far as you don’t overmix.
Pour the mixture into the pan and gently tap it to even out. Bake for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.
Remove the ciambellone from the oven and place it on a cooling rack; let it sit for 10 minutes and then carefully remove it from the pan and place it on the rack to let it cool completely. 



Notes
All ingredients must be at room temperature.Do not open the oven door to check the cake until at least 30 minutes have passed from when you put it inside.If you see that 40 minutes have passed and the cake is not completely baked, cover it with foil to prevent the surface from browning too much and keep baking for another 15-20 minutes.For the original ciambellone shape you will need a ring-shaped pan. If you don’t have it you can use a plum-cake pan or a 23cm round pan.

38,https://www.letitiaclark.co.uk/post/ciambellone-yoghurt-pot-cake," Also known simply as ‘yoghurt cake’, almost every Nonna in Italy will make a version of this recipe, which must be the simplest and most versatile cake in history.  There is something nostalgic and comforting about a very simple, soft and springy sponge cake with its golden crust and butter-yellow crumb. The English have Victoria Sponge, the Italians, Ciambellone.  Usually baked in a bundt or ring tin, the method involves using a small yoghurt pot (125ml/150ml) to measure every ingredient into the mixing bowl, starting with the yoghurt itself.  It is the ideal breakfast, its uncomplicated sweetness balancing a coffee perfectly. This is Franca’s recipe. She does not bake. Ever. Except this, which she knows is fool-proof. A cake for baking-haters then, too. The method is wonderfully slap-dash, and totally forgiving. If only baking could always be thus.  Makes 1 X 26cm ring tin cake  1 pot plain yoghurt 2 pots of caster sugar 3 pots of plain flour 1 pot of sunflower oil 3 whole eggs Zest of 1 lemonZest of 1 orange 15g (3 tsps) baking powderFew drops of vanilla extract (see note) NOTE: Here in Sardinia the baking powder comes in ready-to-use 16g sachets. For some reason it is always pre-flavoured with vanilla. If you replace it with a drop of vanilla extract you will achieve a similar result.  Method:  Preheat the oven to 180. Grease (with melted butter and a pastry brush) and flour the tin well. Decant all of the yoghurt into a blender/mixer. Use the same pot to measure all of the other ingredients into the mixer (you don’t need to rinse it between measuring). Add the eggs, lemon zest and orange zest, the flour and the baking powder and the vanilla and mix well, until smooth. Pour into the prepared tin and bake for 40-50 minutes, until risen and firm to the touch. ",ciambellone

Long before the Italian food and cooking craze spread to the south of Italy, Rosetta Costantino had delved into the culinary traditions of Calabria bringing the rich history back to many of us with roots originated from the toe of the boot.  Her two cookbooks, My Calabria and Southern Italian Desserts have been cherished by many family members and friends.  Naturally, I was delighted when a  dear friend and business associate with grandparents born in Cosenza asked me about inviting Rosetta to Enoteca La Storia  to present a program on Calabrian food.
Edwin, chef extraordinaire, was delighted to foray into Calabria’s rich history through Rosetta’s books; he carefully selected menu items to illustrate the range of dishes found in the local cuisine.  My many trips to Calabria, as Borgia Catanzaro is our ancestral homeland, made me want to support Edwin’s efforts in any way possible, so I offered to prepare a dessert or two from Rosetta’s book, Southern Italian Desserts.

Ciambella of one sort or another is found in every region of Italy, the single commonality – ciambella is ring shaped.  Typically a homey sort of cake made at home by La Mamma or La Nonna, Ciambella is a satisfying confection generally composed of staple ingredients such as flour, butter, sugar and perhaps a simple flavoring of lemon peel.  The ideal breakfast, treat or snack at any time of day.

Ciambella all’Arancia or Orange Scented Olive Oil Cake reflects beautifully the rustic elegance of the Calabrian kitchen.  Olive trees adorn the hillsides alongside groves of citrus, basic local ingredients which come together to create a moist and flavorful, yet not to sweet cake.

Rosetta’s instructions brought back memories of my grandmother preparing cookies and similar types of cakes in her kitchen with only wooden spoons and a large ceramic bowl.

Moist, with the fragrance of an orange grove Ciambella all’ Arancia is comforting at any time of the day.  Grazie Rosetta, for sharing you passion with you readers bringing us a taste of La Bella Calabria.

Ciambella all’Arancia is a recipe you will prepare over and over again.  Author: Adapted by Paula Barbarito-Levitt from Rosetta Costantino Cuisine: Calabrese Serves: 12 servings   Ingredients  3 cups all purpose flour 1 Tbs baking powder ½ tsp. kosher salt plus a pinch for the egg whites 4 large eggs at room temperature, separated 1¼ cup plus 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar ¾ mild flavored (buttery) extra virgin olive oil 3 Tbs. freshly grated orange peel, from fresh oranges 2 cups fresh orange juice 2 tsp. pure orange extract - optional ⅓ cup packed finely chopped candied orange peel, if you do not candy the peel at home, select a good quality product     Instructions  Preheat the oven to 375º and place the rack in the center position. Butter and flour a 10”, 12 cup bundt style pan, tapping out any excess flour. Stir together the flour, baking powder and ½ teaspoon of salt with a wire whisk until well combined. In another bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and 1¼ cup of sugar until thick. Add the olive oil, orange zest, 1½ cup of the orange juice and the extract if you are using it; whisk together until combined. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet mixing until just combined, but be certain there are no lumps remaining. Beat the egg whites in the work bowl of a standing mixer with a pinch of salt at medium-high speed until medium-firm peaks are formed; do not let the whites become dry. Using a large spatula, gently fold the egg whites into the batter, followed by the candied orange peel. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan and place it into the oven. Combine the remaining orange juice with the 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar, stir well to dissolve the sugar and set aside. Bake until the top of the cake splits, turns golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean - about 40 minutes. Allow the cake to cool to a point at which you are able to handle it, generally about 20 minutes after it is removed from the oven. Run a sharp knife around the edges to loosen any area which may have adhered to the pan. Umtold the cake, turning it back to split side up. Place on a wire rack set over a lined baking pan, cool. Once the cake has cooled, slowly pour the orange juice mixture over the top of the cake allowing it so soak in as you pour. Use a pastry brush to brush the remaining orange syrup over the sides and center of the cake Serve the cake by cutting it into slices using a thin sharp or serrated knife. Store leftovers at room temperature well wrapped for up to 2 days or freeze for up to one month.    3.5.3226

40,https://www.breadexperience.com/ciambella-mandorlata-an-italian-easter-bread/,"Ciambella Mandorlata, an Italian Easter bread that originated in Bologna in the Emilia Romagna region, is typically baked in the shape of a ring, to represent the unity of the family.

Aparna, of My Diverse Kitchen, chose this lovely bread as the bread of the month for the Bread Baking Babes.
Ciambella is made with an enriched yeast dough and has a soft brioche-like texture.  It is topped with crunchy sweet spiced almonds, which in my opinion, is the best part.
The traditional method for shaping this bread is to roll the dough into two long ropes, twist them together, and pinch the ends to fashion a ring-shaped bread.  However, this bread can also be baked as a loaf or doughnut-shaped.

The original recipe makes a largish ring or loaf of Ciambella.
I decided to shape two smaller rings because my dough was made with whole wheat pastry flour and white whole wheat flour, and it was a little tricky trying to shape one large ring.  I also gave the dough a cold ferment in the refrigerator for a couple of days and shaped it cold.  Giving it a cold ferment help develop the structure and shaping it cold made it much easier to work with.
One of the other bakers recommended tenting the bread, if necessary, to keep it from burning during the bake cycle.  I didn’t end up tenting the bread, but I did turn the oven down after about 10 minutes.  Some of the almonds got a wee bit toastier than I anticipated, but even so, I really enjoyed the crunchy topping.

Typically baked for Easter, but generally eaten throughout the year, and mostly at breakfast, this Italian Easter Bread goes well with coffee.  I enjoyed slices of the first loaf toasted and spread with butter or just plain.
Some people also like to spread it with jam, but I didn’t want to cover up the flavor of the bread by spreading it with something other than butter.  Did I mention I really enjoyed the toasted almond crunch.

The good thing about making two smaller loaves is that I was able to enjoy one loaf and save the other one for later.  I wrapped the second loaf in some bees wrap I’ve been testing and it rested on the counter for a week.
This bread keeps really well due to the enrichments (milk, butter, eggs, sugar). Wrapping it in bees wrap instead of storing it in a plastic bag worked really well.  Even after a week, it still made for really good toast. I also think it would make great French toast.
Here is a breakdown of the changes I made to the original recipe:

Decreased the amount of dried yeast from 2 teaspoons to 1 teaspoon
Used a combination of 85% extraction white soft wheat and home milled white wheat flour instead of regular bread flour
Reduced the eggs from 3 large to 2 large
Reduced the amount of butter used from 9 tablespoons to 8 tablespoons (1 stick)
Used the zest of 2 large lemons instead of 3 regular lemons
Used demerara sugar instead of granulated sugar
Used slivered almonds instead of blanched almonds and didn’t toast them ahead of time
Used almond milk instead of regular milk
Increased the amount of water slightly due to the whole grains
Added in some lemon extract; almond extract would also be really good in this bread
Gave the dough a cold ferment in the refrigerator for about 2 days instead of baking the loaf the same day

 
 Ciambella Mandorlata | Italian Easter Bread      Save Print   Ciambella Mandorlata, an Italian Easter bread that originated in Bologna in the Emilia Romagna region, is typically baked in the shape of a ring, to represent the unity of the family.  Author: Bread Experience Recipe type: Enriched Yeast Bread Cuisine: Italian Bread Serves: 1 Large or 2 Smaller Loaves   Ingredients For the dough:  1 tsp instant dry yeast ½ cup lukewarm milk (I used almond milk) 350 grams pastry flour (I used Carolina Ground Pastry 85 milled from GA wheat) 140 grams White Whole Wheat flour (I used Clarks Cream, freshly-milled) 2 tsp sea salt ⅓ cup demerara sugar grated zest of 2 large lemons 113 grams, 1 stick unsalted butter, softened 2 large eggs, beaten ½ cup water, plus 2 Tbsp. add'l if using whole wheat ½ tsp lemon extract, optional  For the topping:  4 tsp ground cinnamon 40 g / 3 tbsp demerara sugar 180 g / ¾ cup sliced almonds 1 egg yolk     Instructions  In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, sugar, yeast, and lemon zest. In a separate container, combine the beaten eggs, milk, and extract. Pour the milk/egg mixture over the dry ingredients and stir with a Danish dough whisk or wooden spoon. Work in the softened butter. Add the water 1 tablespoon at a time, as needed, to form a soft, sticky dough. If using whole wheat, you'll probably need to add additional water. Cover the dough and let it rest in the bowl for 30 minutes. Stretch and fold the dough. The dough should start to feel more cohesive after the rest. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, a dish towel, a plate, or my new favorite, bees wrap. Let the dough bulk ferment (rest in the bowl) at room temperature about 4-5 hours. Perform a stretch and fold after 45 minutes, then 2 more times, at the 45-min mark. After the 3rd stretch and fold, let the dough rest for 2-3 more hours. Proceed to shaping or place in the refrigerator and let it cold ferment for 24-48 hours. I put my dough in the refrigerator after 5 hours and let it cold ferment for about 36 hours or so. After the cold ferment, you can let the dough warm up to room temperature, but I found it easier to work with cold. Remove the dough from the bowl, shape it into a ball, then let rest, covered with a dish towel, for about 15 minutes. Divide the dough into two equal pieces for one large loaf, or 4 equal pieces for 2 smaller loaves. Roll each piece into a 14-16-inch-long rope. Twist two of the dough of ropes together. Place the twisted rope(s) on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Shape into rings by bringing the two ends of the rope together. Pinch them to seal and cover with a dish towel. Proof until doubled in size, about 1 1 ⁄2 hours. Prepare the topping by mixing the cinnamon, sugar, almonds, and egg yolk in a bowl. Use a spatula or wooden spoon to spread the mixture evenly over the top of the ring. Bake at 400F in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, then turn oven down to 375F, and bake an additional 15-20 minutes (for 2 loaves), or 30-35 minutes for a large loaf, or until golden and hollow sounding when tapped underneath. Tent with foil, if necessary. Cool on a wire rack.     Notes Adapted from Ultimate Bread by Eric Treuille and Ursula Ferrigno   3.5.3251

41,https://www.cookiemadness.net/2010/03/23/ciambellone-bicolore-two-colored-easter-bread/,"Spread the loveOn our first night in Florence — somewhere between a visit to the Palatina Gallery and dinner at Trattoria 4 Leoni, we ducked into a bookshop in the Oltrarno. It was cold that evening and we were very hungry, but our dinner reservation wasn’t until 7:30.The selection of English books was pretty limited, but there was one Italian cookbook with an English translation. It was in this book that I discovered the Ciambellone Bicolore, a two colored Easter Bread.At the time, I didn’t ponder over what a Ciambellone was. I just focused on the recipe and tried to memorize the ingredients and technique for this chocolate marble cake baked in what seems to be Italy’s most popular cake pan, the ring pan or savarin mold. At the time, I figured I’d adapt it to a traditional Bundt pan and that’s what I ended up doing, but at one point during the trip I did purchase my own ring pan/savarin form so that I could make more Ciambellone.So here’s my adaptation of the Ciambellone Bicolore made in a Bundt pan. I’ve included several notes below.Ciambellone Bicolore4 large eggs, room temperature
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
2 1/2 cups (11.25 oz) white all purpose flour**
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 scant teaspoon salt
1 cup extra light olive oil**
1 cup milk, room temperature
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
A little less than 1/2 cup dark cocoa powder (Hershey’s European style)Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 10 inch Bundt pan with flour-added cooking spray or grease thoroughly with butter and dust with flour.In a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, beat the eggs on high for about a minute. Slowly pour in the sugar and beat the sugar and eggs on one of the higher speeds for about 7 or 8 minutes.While the eggs and sugar are beating, thoroughly mix together the flour, baking powder and salt. You can sift them together if you feel like it, but it’s not necessary.Remove the mixing bowl from the mixing stand and with a heavy duty scraper or large spoon, stir in the flour mixture all the while trying to maintain the lightness of the egg/sugar mixture. Stir in the oil, then mix together the milk and vanilla and stir in the milk until you have a thick, dense, uniform batter. Again, do your best to stir without overbeating the flour.Pour half (about 3 cups) of the batter into the pan. To the remaining batter, add the cocoa powder and stir until it’s mixed. Pour the chocolate batter into the pan over the vanilla batter. No need to swirl. The batter will form its own interesting pattern as it bakes.Bake for 40-50 minutes (time will vary depending on oven, color of your pan, weight of your pan, etc.) or until a chopstick or cake tester inserted in the cake comes out clean.Cool cake in pan for about 10 minutes then carefully turn from pan and let it cool completely. Dust with sugar if you have some.I served this with whipped cream and berries.**I used bleached flour.  If you don’t like the idea of bleached, use unbleached.  However, I’ve read (and experienced) that you get better results with cakes when you used bleached.  I think it has to do with the type of wheat they use in bleached flour and the protein content.  So my preference for cakes, at least at the moment, is bleached flour.**For the olive oil, use an extra light olive oil and not extra virgin unless you want a funny tasting cake.  I am fairly certain regular vegetable oil would be fine if not great.Related posts:Rum Pound Cake with Chocolate GlazeCinnamon Crown CakeNeapolitan Bundt Cake",ciambellone
42,https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019395-roman-breakfast-cake,"Center a rack in the oven, and heat it to 350. Generously butter a 10-inch tube pan (or use a Bundt pan with minimal crannies), dust the interior with flour and tap out the excess. Be assiduous — this cake is a sticker. Alternatively, use baker’s spray.Whisk together the flour, baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt; set aside.Using a mixer with a whisk attachment, beat the egg whites and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt on medium-high speed until they form firm, glossy peaks. (If you’re using a stand mixer, scrape the whites into another bowl. No need to rinse the mixer bowl.)Fit the mixer with the paddle attachment. Put the sugar and lemon zest in the mixer/mixing bowl, and rub them together until the mixture is fragrant. Add the yolks, and beat on medium speed for 3 minutes, scraping the bowl as needed — the batter will be thick, pale and shiny. With the mixer on medium, pour in the oil and continue to beat for another 3 minutes. Mix in the lemon juice, vanilla and lemon oil, if using, then scrape the bowl well. Turn off the mixer, add the dry ingredients and pulse the mixer a few times to start incorporating them. Work on low until the flour is blended into the batter, which will be smooth and thick.Beat the whites briskly with a whisk (to restiffen them and incorporate any liquid in the bowl), and scrape a few spoonfuls over the batter. Use a flexible spatula to stir them in and lighten the batter. Turn the rest of the whites into the bowl, and fold them in gingerly. If you’re using the berries, gently fold them in just before the whites are fully incorporated. Scrape the batter into the pan, and level the top.Bake the cake for 45 to 50 minutes, until lightly browned; a tester inserted deep into the cake should come out clean. Transfer to a rack, and wait 5 minutes. Run a blunt knife around the edges of the pan to loosen the cake (if possible — it’s not easy with a Bundt), invert onto the rack and unmold. Cool to room temperature. Dust with confectioners’ sugar, if you like.",ciambellone

From the kitchen of One Perfect Bite...I had some fun testing recipes for the Italian Easter Bread that's called Ciambellone. I'm not going to talk about the two recipes that failed, other than to say my evil eye is now trained on the developers and, once they recover, they'll get with the program and do a better job. I am happy to report that I did find a workable recipe. This link,  Chef's Line , will take you to a pod cast that demonstrates exactly how Easter Bread is made.  Ciambellone falls somewhere between a cake and bread on the culinary periodic table. It tastes like soft biscotti and that, of course, makes it perfect to serve with coffee or tea. It also requires no special equipment to make. Flour is piled onto an immaculately clean board and the remainder of the ingredients are added to a fist-made well and mixed into the flour using your equally immaculate fingers. It's then formed into rings and baked. I prefer to make one large ring and use a ring mold to enhance the appearance of the Ciambellone. The recipe appears below the next photo.I also want to share a great recipe for  Soft Sugar Cookies with you. It comes from Denise at Cottage Sisters. I stumbled on it while searching for the Italian Easter Bread. She was kind enough to share the recipe and photo with me so I could pass them on to you. I hope you'll take a look at her fabulous site.Photo courtesy of Cottage SistersCiambellone - Italian Easter Bread...from the kitchen of One Perfect Bite, courtesy of Kitchen Guy at Chef's LineIngredients:4 cups flour3 large eggs1 teaspoon vanilla1 cup granulated sugar1 cup milk1 teaspoon cinnamon1/2 cup vegetable oil or melted butter1 teaspoon baking powder1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest1 egg for egg washConfectioners' sugar for dustingDirections:1) Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour a large baking sheet or a 9-inch tube pan. Set aside.2) Mound flour on a board. Create a well in center of mound. Using your fingers, begin alternating liquid and other dry ingredients into well, mixing until all  ingredients are combined. Knead, adding additional flour if needed, to form a smooth dough.3) Divide into one or two parts and shape into fat rings. Beat additional egg with a teaspoon of water. Brush top of ring with egg wash. Place on baking sheet or into tube pan. Bake 40 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool. Dust with confectioners' sugar.

44,https://sovictoria.co.uk/perfect-ciambella-recipe/,"My love of cake and Italian food is known to all around me. I cannot resist the fresh, comforting flavours of our European cousins. You may have guessed this if you read my Bellini Pavlova recipe.  Just one sniff of zingy Amalfi lemons and the milky warmth of vanilla and the moka pot must be put straight on the stove so that I can start my Sunday the right way.  The Italian way. So apron-up for the perfect ciambella recipe

What’s to love about Ciambella?
What’s not to love? What I adore about Italian food is it’s simplicity; incredible, fresh ingredients that are cooked well and served with love and family.
Ciambella is no different, it tastes of creamy yoghurt, vanilla and lemons. It’s finished with a generous dusting of sweet icing sugar that must be licked from fingers between slices.
If I’m feeling in need of a very lazy Sunday morning, I make the ciambella recipe on Saturday evening. All I need to is shower the cake in sugar, set the moka pot to go and I’m armed with my iPad and ready laze in the garden with Monty, who is also a fan.
However, like most baked food, ciambella is at its best warm. I throw everything in the mixer, let it do all the heavy work, before popping it in the oven whilst I walk the dog.  I then get to reward myself with warm, lemony goodness. Heaven!
Ciambella Recipe
The recipe that I use is inspired by Nigella Lawson’s Yoghurt Pot Cake, I use her method, but I’ve adjusted some of the ingredients to create a more intense lemon flavour

Ingredients

150g plain yoghurt
150ml vegetable oil (plus some for greasing)
3 large free-range eggs
250g caster sugar
1½ teaspoons vanilla extract
zest of a large un-waxed Amalfi lemon
175g plain flour
75g cornflour
icing sugar

                        
Method

Preheat oven to 180°C/160°C Fan/gas mark 4/350°F, and grease your ring mould with a little melted butter.
Separate the eggs and whisk the whites until you have firm peaks,
Whisk the yoghurt, sugar with the egg yolks until airy.
 Slowly add the oil to the egg yolk mixture and when blended, stir in the vanilla and lemon.
Add the two flours a spoon at a time and once it has all be mixed in fold in the whisked fluffy egg whites.
Pour the batter into the ring mould (I got this one).
When cooked, remove it from the oven to a wire rack, letting the cake sit in the tin for 10 minutes before serving
To serve, turn the cake upside down before dusting generously with icing sugar.


                               
Once you try ciambella, like me, you will find yourself making it again and again. Even though it doesn’t sound too good, dunking in your coffee is must-do. (No judging until you’ve tried it.)
Happy baking! (Scroll down for a cute pinnable image to save this recipe to your Pinterest board!)

As always, I use my food processor on low speed and finish off the kneading by hand.Mix the yeast and the milk in a small bowl. Let it stand for 5 to 10 minutes till frothy.

Make a well in the center of the mixture and add the butter, eggs, extracts and dissolved yeast.Mix in the flour from the sides of the well.

Use a rubber spatula or brush to spread the mixture evenly over the top of the ring. If you don’t like using egg on top of your breads like me, leave out the egg yolk. Instead brush the cornstarch mixture on top of the ring. Then evenly sprinkle cinnamon sugar nut mixture over this. Gently press in the nuts using the tip of your fingers. Be careful not to deflate the dough.Bake at 200C (400F) in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, until it is golden and hollow sounding when tapped underneath. Check after 15 minutes.

Fever, February, Fishbones & Fenugreek are not things that grab you as having a lot in common, but on this ever-steep learning curve of Abruzzo culture, I also get to understand the history of words in my native English.
The 3rd February is the feast day of Armenian San Biagio (Saint Blaise).  He was a hermit who was fed by the animals of a nearby forest and who he, in turn, fed when they were ill. His fame stems from melting a fishbone that had stuck in a child’s throat and he’s now the patron saint of throat afflictions. He’s more often than not depicted with wild animals in frescos in churches but sometimes as a pair of wool combs as he died rather nastily by these tearing him apart to “earn” his martyrdom.

Of course it is no coincidence that his miracle is celebrated in February. The original meaning of February stems from the Latin for fever, febris, and it’s this time of year that the Romans had their februa ‘purifying’ festival. This built on the idea that fevers were positive, a purifying test, and if you got through you’d be all set for sunny spring. Numa Pompilius, King of Rome in c700bc built this purification festival into a month when 10 months became 12 in the Roman calendar.
Yesterday evening our Italian teacher’s mamma kindly sent us these Ciambella di S. Biagio to start the day with; children are expected to eat a whole one in protection for the coming year.  If they are really diligent and make it to church, olio santo, the best of the oil from the previous harvest which is still given to the local priest and used in blessings is rubbed onto the adam’s apple.

The ciambella are surprisingly moreish despite their dryness, great dipped in a small glass of wine, and strangely great with a cup of coffee or Earl Grey tea. Their secret protective ingredient is fenugreek. These seeds are considered a traditional cure for fevers, hot flushes, bronchial problems.
The recipes for these biscuits vary from village to village I am sure, and probably a little different to Abruzzo’s most popular 3-day sagra for St Biagio in Castiglione a Casauria.  Here the Ciambella di S. Biagio are dipped in an ancient local wine called Moscato di Castiglione.   In Taranta Peligna, the unsalted biscuits created to celebrate their patron saint are known as Panicelle, which resemble the Saint giving a traditional blessing, here’s the local community making them for their celebration.

 
This recipe is taken from ‘L’antica Cucina Teramana’ by Nunzia D’Antuono, a collective of Grandmas’ recipes from the small town of Tossicia .

The recipes for these biscuits vary from village to village I am sure, and probably a little different to Abruzzo’s most popular 3-day sagra for St Biagio in Castiglione a Casauria.  Here the Ciambella di S. Biagio are dipped in an ancient local wine called Moscato di Castiglione.   In Taranta Peligna, the unsalted biscuits created to celebrate their patron saint are known as Panicelle, which resemble the Saint giving a traditional blessing, here’s the local community making them for their celebration.

 
This recipe is taken from ‘L’antica Cucina Teramana’ by Nunzia D’Antuono, a collective of Grandmas’ recipes from the small town of Tossicia .

I'm house and dog sitting for friends for two weeks.  My favourite place to hang out is their backyard. A gazebo, pretty fairy lights, and a comfy chair.  
 

 
Earlier tonight I was enjoying a glass of wine, a good book and the dog at my feet. 
 

 
The book, Summer by the Sea by Susan Wiggs is an easy summer beach read.  Light and fluffy, it's the story of star-crossed childhood loves.  I'm only half way through but I'm pretty sure girl will end up with boy.  (If they don't then the book will surprise me). While I am enjoying the book and I will read more by the same author, what's got me about the book so far is the delicious sounding recipes. The girl, Rosa owns an Italian restaurant by the sea hence between chapters there are Italian recipes.  I shouldn't have been reading the book before dinner.  The recipes just made me hungry.  
I can't pronounce this...Caimbellone...but it has lemon in it.  Lemon, I like.  A lot. I had to stop reading to bake.  
 

 
 
Yep, I put the book down, delayed dinner and baked.  Lucky for me, Andrea and Sean had all the ingredients in their pantry.  (I need to go grocery shopping and restock).
 

 
It's an easy recipe. But messy.  Starting with 4 cups of flour in a mound on a board.  I skipped the board and just used the (clean) counter top.   Then alternately add the wet and dry ingredients, mixing and kneading with your hands. Told you it's messy.
 

 
The recipe said to add extra flour as needed.  I found I needed to add 1/2 a cup of flour for every 1/2 cup of liquid.  So I added 1 cup of milk in 1/4 cup increments, alternating with a 1/4 cup of flour. Same with the oil.
 

 
It was quick to make.  The dough didn't require a lot of kneading, the hardest part was getting the flour amount correct.  I formed the dough into two fat rings as instructed, next time I'd braid the two rings. Just to make them prettier.
 

 
The kitchen smelled awesome while the rings were baking. The dog pretty much sat in front of the oven.  Waiting the 40 minutes for the Ciambellone to bake was torture.  Although I did eat dinner and wash up in that time.  
 

 
Then I had a huge slice of warm ciambellone straight out of the oven.  It's pretty good. Would be better with a cup of coffee for breakfast.  If I only I knew how to operate Sean's fancy coffee machine. Or if I had a bottle of Frangelico so I could make the Caffe Frangelico. Frangelico is hazelnut.  Hazelnut, I like.  A lot.  Lemon (in the Ciambellone) and hazelnut (in the Caffe Frangelico) together?  Yes please. Yum.
 
All the recipe from Summer by the Sea are here.

Sometimes all you need is a slice of simple, delicate, warm yogurt cake!





Today I was craving a slice of cake and I just had to bake this! ;)
It reminds of home, of being a kid and baking with my mum, of having an afternoon snack (merenda) with a slice of homemade ciambellone.
It is perfect for breakfast, dipped in your morning caffelatte! It is also incredibly easy to make!
Ingredients

300g plain flour
1 tbsp potato starch
250g Greek or natural yoghurt
200g caster sugar
2 eggs
2 tsp baking powder
1 tbsp vanilla extract
1/2 cup sunflower oil
zest of 1 lemon
pinch of salt
icing sugar to decorate








Preparation
Pre-heat the oven to 180 C°.
Beat the eggs with the sugar, then slowly add the sunflower oil. Add the yogurt, potato starch, lemon zest and a pinch of salt. Mix all ingredients with an electric whisk.
Gradually add the flour, vanilla extract and baking powder. Pour the mix into a greased cake tin. Bake for 35/40 minutes. Do not open the oven for at least 30 minutes.
Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool down on a wire rack for about 10 minutes. Dust the top with icing sugar.
Enjoy dipping a slice of cake in warm caffelatte or milk!

This is such a delicious, easy cake. I whipped it together with my young son. We picked it because it was so easy and I didn't have high expectations but I feel like I discovered the little black dress of breakfast/snacking cakes! The texture is lush and the flavor is rich and lemony but not too sweet.
