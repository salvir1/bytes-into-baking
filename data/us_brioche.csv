Add 4 of the eggs and the milk and continue mixing on low speed to combine. As soon as the dough starts to clump together, remove the paddle attachment and attach the dough hook. (There will still be unmixed egg and flour in the bowl.) Mix on medium speed for 2 minutes. Using a plastic dough scraper or strong plastic spatula, scrape the bowl and hook. Continue to mix until the dough is firm and elastic, about 2 minutes more. The dough may stick to the hook at this point, but that’s OK. Scrape the dough off the hook again.With the mixer on medium-low speed, add half of the butter, a few pieces at a time. Scrape down the bowl and dough hook, and remove the dough hook. Give the dough a few kneads by hand in the bowl, repeatedly folding the dough over on itself, to help incorporate the butter. Reattach the dough hook and add the remaining butter, a few pieces at a time, mixing on medium-low speed. Once all of the butter has been added, increase the mixer speed to medium and mix for 4 minutes. Scrape the dough hook and the sides and bottom of the bowl. Mix again until the dough is smooth, soft, and shiny, about 4 minutes more. You’ll hear the dough slap against the sides of the bowl when it’s ready. (If your kitchen is warm, the dough may seem too loose at this point. Resist the urge to add extra flour, or the brioche may be tough.)Use a plastic dough scraper or a spatula to turn the dough out onto a clean, very lightly floured work surface. The dough will be very moist. Knead it by hand a few times and then form it into a ball by folding the sides into the middle at 12, 3, 6, and 9 o’clock. Flip the dough over, place your palms on either side of the dough, and tuck it under itself, turning the dough as you tuck to form a loose ball with a smooth top. Transfer the dough, smooth side up, to a clean large bowl. Cover loosely with plastic and let the dough rise in a warm, draft-free spot until doubled in size, about 1 hour.Use the dough scraper or spatula to turn the dough out, smooth top down, onto a very lightly floured work surface. Again, form it into a ball by folding the sides into the middle at 12, 3, 6, and 9 o’clock. Flip the dough over, place your palms on either side of the dough, and tuck it under itself, turning the dough as you tuck to form a loose ball with a smooth top. Transfer the dough, smooth side up, back to the bowl. Cover tightly with plastic. At this point, for best flavor refrigerate the dough overnight. Or let it sit out until doubled in size, about 1 hour. The warmer the room, the faster the brioche will rise, so keep an eye on it.If the dough was refrigerated, let it warm to room temperature, about 2 hours.Butter sixteen 3-inch brioche à tête molds (use molds that are 3 to 3-1/4 inches wide across the top and at least 1-1/4 inches high).Turn the dough out, smooth top down, onto a clean work surface. Form the dough into a ball by folding the sides into the middle at 12, 3, 6, and 9 o’clock. Using a scale and a bench knife, divide the dough into 2 equal pieces, about 1 lb. 3 oz. each. Divide each half into 8 equal pieces of about 2-1/2 oz. each, for a total of 16 pieces of dough. Cover the dough with plastic to prevent it from drying out.Roll each piece of dough into a tight ball by cupping your hand over the dough and moving it in a circular motion with the fingers of that hand slightly tucked in.To form the “tête,” or head, hold your hand perpendicular to the work surface, with your fingers straight and tightly together (like you’re going to do a karate chop). Working with one ball of dough at a time (keeping the others covered with plastic), press down onto the ball with the side of your hand about one-third of the way from one of the edges of the dough ball (leaving one-third of the dough to one side of your hand, and two-thirds of the dough to the other side of your hand). Saw back and forth with your hand almost all of the way through until you get a shape that looks like a bowling pin, or a head and body connected by a very thin, almost translucent neck. Holding the dough by the “head,” turn the dough upright so the body is resting on the work surface. Lower the head down into the body, pressing deeply into the body and spreading it with your thumbs and index fingers to make a nest for the head. Tighten the body around the nestled head by tucking and lifting the body up around the head. Gently place the dough in one of the prepared molds, body down. Repeat with the remaining dough. Transfer the molds to a large rimmed baking sheet.Cover the brioches very loosely with plastic. Let the dough rise until almost doubled in size and filling the molds, about 1 hour. It should spring back when gently poked with a finger.Meanwhile, position an oven rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 375°F. It is important that the oven be thoroughly heated so the brioches bake evenly.In a small bowl, make the egg wash by beating the remaining 2 eggs plus 1 egg yolk and a pinch of salt. Lightly brush the top of the brioches (without letting the egg wash drip down into the molds or pans, which would make the brioches stick to their molds). Bake until dark golden-brown on top and golden on the sides (you can lift the brioche slightly to peek in at the edge of the mold), about 18 minutes. (The internal temperature should be 190°F.) Let the brioches cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes before unmolding. Serve while they’re still warm to the touch.",brioche
5,https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/brioche-recipe,"In a stand mixer or bread machine (programmed for dough), mix together all of the ingredients to form a smooth, shiny dough. Don't worry; what starts out as a sticky mess becomes beautifully satiny as it kneads. This dough takes longer than most to develop, so be prepared to let the dough knead for up to 15 to 20 minutes in a stand mixer. Also, we don't recommend trying to knead it by hand. If you're using a bread machine, let it complete its kneading cycle, then continue as directed below., Form the dough into a ball (it'll be very soft), place it in a greased bowl, cover the bowl, and it let rise for 1 hour. Then refrigerate the dough for several hours, or overnight. This will slow the fermentation and chill the butter, making the dough easier to shape., Divide the chilled dough into 12 pieces to make mini-brioche (brioche buns); leave it whole for one large round brioche; or divide it in half for two 8 1/2"" x 4 1/2"" loaves., Place the dough into the greased pan(s) of your choice, cover lightly, and let rise for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, until it's doubled and looks very puffy. If you're making two loaves, it's fun to make simple three-strand braids, and set them in the loaf pans., To bake a large, round brioche: Place the pan into a preheated 400°F oven. After 10 minutes, reduce the oven heat to 350°F and bake for about 30 to 35 minutes more. Check the brioche after 15 minutes; tent with aluminum foil if it appears to be browning too quickly. Brioche should be a deep brown when done, should sound hollow when tapped, and will read 190°F at the center using an instant-read thermometer. (It's easy to underbake, since it browns so quickly!) Remove the brioche from the oven, and after 10 minutes remove it from the pan to cool completely on a rack., To bake the mini brioches: Place the pan(s) onto a baking sheet for easy handling, as shown; then nestle that baking sheet into another baking sheet, to protect the buns' bottoms from over-browning. Bake the buns in a preheated 375°F oven for 25 to 30 minutes (tent after 10 minutes if they're browning too quickly). Remove them from the oven, let stand for 5 minutes, then turn them out onto a rack., To bake the loaves: Allow the loaves to rise until they've nearly reached the rim of the pan, about 3 hours. Set the loaf pans on a baking sheet, for easy handling. Bake in a preheated 350°F oven for 30 to 35 minutes, tenting with foil after 15 to 20 minutes.",brioche

8,https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-brioche-224507,"Let the butter soften: About an hour before you plan to bake, place the butter on the counter to soften. If you&#x27;re short on time, microwave the butter at half-power in 10-second bursts. The butter should be pliable and easily spreadable, but not melted.Prepare the brioche dough: Combine the yeast and water in the bowl of a stand mixer, and allow the yeast to dissolve for a few minutes. Add the sugar and the eggs, and stir until the eggs are broken up. Add the salt and 4 cups of the flour. Stir until you&#x27;ve formed a shaggy, floury dough.Knead the dough for about 2 minutes: With a dough hook on low speed, knead the dough for about 2 minutes, until all the flour has been absorbed and the dough comes together in a fairly smooth ball.Begin adding the butter: Increase the mixer speed to medium. Begin adding the butter one tablespoon at time. Wait until one lump is mostly mixed in before adding the next. Stop and scrape down the sides of the mixer as needed until all the butter is added.Beat the dough for 5 minutes: Once all the butter is added, continue to beat the dough for about 5 minutes, until all the butter is completely absorbed. When finished, the dough should look glossy and supple, and it should jiggle slightly when you shake the bowl, like firmly set custard.Cover and let rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until doubled in bulk: The dough can rise in the bowl in which it was mixed. Cover loosely and place the bowl somewhere warm until roughly doubled in bulk.Refrigerate the dough overnight: This dough is much easier to work with once it has chilled, and the flavor improves with a cool overnight rest. Once it has doubled in bulk, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the fridge. Let the dough rest overnight, or for up to 2 days. It might rise a little more in the fridge; if it looks like it will spill out of the bowl, lift the edges to degas it slightly, but don&#x27;t punch it down.Prepare the loaves: Grease two loaf tins. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter and pat into a rectangle; the dough will be quite stiff and easy to shape. Divide the rectangle into 12 equal pieces, then roll each piece into a ball. Tuck 6 balls of dough into each loaf tin, staggering them slightly so you create a braided look. (Alternatively, you can divide the dough in half and shape each half into a standard sandwich loaf.)Let the brioche rise 1 1/2 to 2 hours: Cover the brioche loosely and place somewhere warm. Let them rise until they&#x27;re doubled in bulk, look puffy and pillow-like, and are just starting to peek over the top of the pan — 1 1/2 to 2 hours. (If in doubt, it&#x27;s better to under-proof rather than over-proof these brioche loaves, so bake them as soon as you start wondering if they&#x27;re ready.)Preheat the oven to 350°F. Begin preheating the oven when the brioche has risen to just under the tops of the pans, about 30 minutes before you estimate they&#x27;re ready to bake. Place a rack in the middle position.Brush the brioche with glaze: Whisk together the yolk and water for the glaze. Brush it evenly over the tops of the brioche. Try not to leave any drips in the corners of the pan or under the loaves.Bake the brioche 30 to 40 minutes: When done, the loaves will look puffed, glossy, and golden-brown on top, and register 190°F internally. If the loaves puff up a lot in the oven, brush a second time with egg wash so the tops are evenly glossy.Cool the brioche: Cool the brioche for about 5 minutes in their tins, then gently ease them out and transfer them to a wire rack to finish cooling completely.",brioche

Here is a classic fall recipe with a twist. I’ve added the tartness of pomegranate seeds to the mellow sweetness of pears and draped the whole thing in a rich, buttery, tender brioche dough. It is a lovely and quick dessert, especially if you have a bucket of brioche on hand. For those of you who do not already own The New Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day, here is the recipe and it can be used for all of these wonderful treats: caramel sticky buns, grilled fruit tart, fresh fruit muffins, Brioche à tête, apricot pastries and fabulous doughnuts! Actually the possibilities are endless, just use your imagination and let us know what treats you’ve come up with.
Brioche Dough (makes about 4 loaves)

1 1/2 cups (340g) lukewarm water
1 tablespoon Red Star Platinum, Active Dry, or Quick-Rise yeast (1 packet)
1 tablespoon kosher salt
8 large eggs at room temperature, lightly beaten
1/2 cup (170g) honey
1 1/2 cups (340g) unsalted butter, melted
7 1/2 cups (1065g) unbleached all-purpose flour
Mix the yeast, salt, eggs honey and melted butter with the water in a 5-quart bowl, or lidded (not airtight) food container.
Mix in the flour, using a spoon until all of the flour is incorporated.
Cover (not airtight), and allow to sit at room temperature for about two hours. Note: Sometimes with brioche, with so much cold egg, if you don’t use warm enough water, the initial rise can be very slow. Professionals would fix this by letting the eggs come to room temperature, which solves the problem. You can do that, or just make sure that your final mixture of egg/butter/water is nice and warm (but not hot, or you can kill the yeast).
The dough can be used as soon as it is chilled. This dough is way too sticky to use after the initial rise, but once it is chilled it is very easy to handle. It can be used to create the Tatin or any of these brioche recipes: caramel sticky buns, grilled fruit tart, Fresh Fruit Muffins, Brioche à tête, apricot pastries and fabulous doughnuts! The dough can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. After that you can freeze the dough.

Brioche Recipe & Video





Printer Friendly Page









Broiche 
      is part of a group of 
      yeast raised Breakfast Pastries called Viennoiserie. 
When I took a week long Viennoiserie Class at the 
San Francisco 
      Baking Institute (SFBI) we made this bread. It is an enriched bread, 
      which means it is made with lots of butter an eggs. This gives it a 
      buttery flavor and a wonderfully light and tender 
      crumb. Brioche has so many uses, both sweet and savory. In this recipe we 
      are making it in loaf form.  




 A few notes on technique and 
      ingredients. This dough is kneaded for a long time (20 to 25 minutes) which produces a strong dough that 
      cleans your mixing bowl and is silky smooth. If you're new to bread 
      making, I would watch the video as I show you an easy way (the 'window' 
      test) to determine if your dough has been mixed to the correct 
      consistency. After the first fermentation (proofing), I like to 
      refrigerate the dough overnight. This improves the flavor of the Brioche 
      and also makes the dough much easier to work with.As far as 
      ingredients go, for the yeast, I like to use  
      
SAF Gold instant yeast
which is used in baked goods that are high in fat and/or sugar. This type of 
      yeast  gives a good rise and it doesn't need to be proofed. However, 
      if you want to substitute active dry yeast for instant yeast you need to 
      increase the amount of yeast by about 20%. For the salt I like to use 
      kosher salt. For the butter, I like to use unsalted butter.

Brioche: Place the 
flour, yeast, and salt in the bowl of your 
electric stand 
mixer, fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat until combined. Add the eggs and 
milk and beat until combined. Replace the 
paddle attachment with the dough hook, and knead the dough on 1st speed for 
four minutes. Increase your mixer speed to 2nd speed, and continue to 
knead the dough for another three minutes. Next, with the mixer on 2nd speed, gradually add the sugar 
over five minutes. 

Place the cold butter between 
two sheets of parchment or wax paper. With a rolling pin, pound the 
 
butter until it's pliable but still cold. Cut the butter into pieces and add it to the 
dough. Knead the dough, on 2nd speed, for another 10 to 15 minutes or until the 
dough cleans the bowl and is smooth (not sticky) and elastic. To check to see if the dough is 
fully kneaded, use the 'windowpane' test. To do this, start with a small fistful 
of dough. Gently stretch it. For a fully kneaded dough you should be able to 
stretch the dough quite thin, without it tearing, so that you can almost see 
through it.  
Place your dough in a large, 
lightly oiled 
bowl, cover with plastic 
wrap, and let sit at room temperature (73 - 76 degree F) (23 - 24 degree C) 
for about 1 hour. After 30 minutes you need to 
stretch the dough to equalize its temperature and this also helps to strengthen 
the dough. To stretch the dough, gently take one edge of the dough and stretch 
it and then fold it onto the top of the dough. Turn your bowl 180 degrees and 
stretch the dough in the same way. Then turn your bowl a quarter turn (90 
degrees) and stretch the dough in the same way. Then turn your bowl 180 degrees 
and repeat the process. After that flip your dough so the bottom is now the top, 
and cover. Let proof another 30 minutes and then place the covered dough in the 
refrigerator to chill overnight. (This makes the dough much easier to shape and 
also improves the flavor of the Brioche.)
Next morning prepare two - 
9 x 5 x 3 inch (23 x 13 x 8 cm)
loaf pans. Heavily butter or spray the 
pans with a non stick vegetable spray.
Then remove the dough from the 
refrigerator and 
divide  into 12 equal-sized pieces 
(about 80 grams each). Then, working 
with one piece of dough at a time, flatten into a round. (You may want to lightly 
flour your hands.) Take the edges of the dough 
and fold them into the center and gently seal. Then flip your dough over so the 
smooth side is facing up. With the palm of your hand rotate the ball of dough on 
your surface to create surface tension and to seal the edges of the dough 
completely.
Place six rounds of the dough 
in each loaf pan, placing them on a slight angle to each other (this will give 
the Brioche a braided look) (see video on how this is done). Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let proof 

at room temperature (about 73 - 76 degree F) (23 - 24 degree C) until nice and 
puffy and almost 
doubled in size (because the dough is very cold, this 
could take 2 1/2 to 3 hours). 

Next, preheat your oven to 350 
degree F (180 degree C). 
When ready 
to bake, remove the plastic wrap and, with a pastry brush, lightly brush the 
tops of the Brioche with the beaten egg. If desired, sprinkle the tops with 
Pearl Sugar. Place in the preheated oven and bake for about 25 to 30 minutes 
or until golden brown and shiny. If you tap the bread it will sound hollow. 
About halfway through baking turn your pans front to back to promote even 
baking. (Internal temperature of a fully baked Brioche should be about 190 
degree F (88 degree C)). Remove from oven and place on a wire rack to cool for 
about five minutes. Then remove the breads from their pans, placing the breads 
top side up on a wire rack.
Makes 
two - 9 inch loaves of Brioche.

Everyone knows of Marie Antoinette’s famous words ushering in the French revolution. Upon hearing that the people were running out of bread, it’s said she retorted, “Well then, let them eat cake!”

But it turns out this story has been passed down just a little bit incorrectly.
The princess in question was actually Maria Theresa, who ruled a few generations before Antoinette. And the phrase was actually: “Let them eat brioche!”
It turns out her intentions were not cruel at all.

The sweet bread was considered blessed in the Catholic Church, thus Theresa was calling on the Church to feed the poor.
But this misinterpretation and misattribution of the story caused a ruckus early on, feeding national hatred for Marie Antoinette.
What has not been passed down in error, however, is the technique for making this soft, sweet dough. And it’s useful for making a range of pastries: from sandwich loaves to doughnuts, hand pies, and more.
The Science Stuff
Brioche is an enriched bread, meaning the basic bread ingredients – flour, water, salt, and yeast – have been enriched with butter, eggs, and sugar. These ingredients give the dough richness in flavor, tenderness in chew, and a soft, sweet outer crust.

America’s master bread baker Peter Reinhart explains that historically there have been two different types of brioche: poor man’s brioche and rich man’s brioche. The primary difference between the two is the ratio of butter to flour in a given recipe.

The Bread Baker’s Apprentice: Mastering the Art of Extraordinary Bread
For more on this topic, check out Reinhart’s wonderful book The Bread Baker’s Apprentice, available on Amazon.
These terms used to refer to the difference between the sweet pastry-like bread served in the homes of the French elite, versus the leaner loaves savored by the poor.
Today many bakers will make just a single recipe and utilize it for a large variety of purposes in the bakeshop – a medium fat-to-flour ratio works well for both rich pastries and sandwich loaves.
What Can It Do?
Brioche can be used in such a wide variety of applications. The butter gives the chilled dough an almost claylike texture, making it easy to sculpt and shape into your desired treat.
The classic serving is the brioche à tête, a small, round roll baked in a fluted dish with a tiny head (or tête) on top. It is often sprinkled with pearl sugar, lending it a sweet crunch.

But brioche can be used for myriad purposes – from filled braids and hand pies to doughnuts and cinnamon rolls. Plus dinner rolls, sandwich loaves… the list goes on.
Brioche is only limited by your own creativity!

Description
Learn all you need to know to create tender, buttery brioche dough. Turn it into sandwich loaves, doughnuts, hand pies, and more.




Scale
1x2x3x 
Ingredients
For the Sponge:

1/3 cup whole milk
2 teaspoons instant yeast
1 teaspoon granulated sugar
1/2 cup all-purpose flour, divided

For the Dough:

2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons granulated sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
5 large eggs
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature and cut into small pieces




Instructions
To Make the Sponge:

Microwave milk for 30 seconds, until it is hot. Let cool until to 100°F, or until it is just warm to the touch.
Pour into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, and add the sugar, instant yeast, and 1/4 cup flour. Mix on medium-low speed until well-combined.
Sprinkle the remaining flour on top.
Set aside in a warm place to proof for 30 minutes.

To Make the Dough:

In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, and salt for the dough. When the sponge has grown so that flour on top has developed visible cracks, pour the flour mixture over the sponge. Add eggs.
Mix with a dough hook on medium speed for 15 minutes, or until the mixture is smooth and supple, and can pass a windowpane test.
Add the butter to the dough in three parts while mixing on medium speed, fully incorporating it between each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl if needed.
Turn the mixer up to medium-high and mix for 3 minutes.
Transfer the dough to a lightly floured container airtight container with a lid. Allow to proof at room temperature for 30 minutes.
Keeping the dough inside the container, fold it in half vertically, then horizontally. Reseal the lid, and place in the fridge to chill for 12 hours, or overnight.
Remove from the refrigerator and shape the dough as desired, on a well-floured surface.
Let proof at room temperature until the dough slowly springs back when pressed gently.
Bake or fry according to the recipe instructions for your desired treat. A general guide that you may follow is to bake at 350°F until the loaf’s internal temperature reaches 180°F.

Cooking By the Numbers…
Step 1 – Mix Sponge

Microwave the milk for 30 seconds, until it is quite hot to the touch. This kills the enzymes in milk that prevent yeast activity. It will need to cool back down to 100°F (just about body temperature) before moving on to the next step.
Once the milk has cooled, add it to the bowl of a stand mixer with the remaining sponge ingredients: granulated sugar, instant yeast, and 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour. Mix to combine with the whisk or paddle attachment. This will form a thick paste.
Sprinkle the top of this mixture with the remaining 1/4 cup of flour.

Let this sponge sit in a warm place for about 30 minutes to proof. This process helps to wake up the yeast, and adds flavor to the dough. It is particularly useful in making recipes with a high fat content.
As the sponge proofs, it will begin to rise, forming cracks in the flour coating on top. Once large cracks begin to form, like what you see pictured below, the sponge is ready to go.

Step 2 – Mix Dough
While the sponge proofs, mix together the remaining flour, sugar, and salt for the dough. Once the sponge is ready, pour these dry ingredients over the sponge, then add the eggs.

I like to remember the order of operations here by reminding myself that it’s a wet/dry sandwich: the wet sponge, then the dry flour, then the wet eggs.
Combining the ingredients in this order helps to incorporate them thoroughly.
Mix with a hook attachment on medium speed for 15 minutes. Brioche can really take a good beating when it comes to kneading, so a higher mixing speed is helpful here.
Start a little slower to avoid covering your countertops with flour!

Work the dough until the gluten has fully formed – if you pinch off a piece and slowly stretch it, it should become thin enough to see through. This is what bakers call the “windowpane test.”
The gluten will not develop any further after the butter is added to the dough, so it vital that it be fully formed during this process.

Step 3 – Add Fat
Once the dough passes the windowpane test, begin adding the small pieces of room temperature butter.
Add about 1/3 of the butter at a time, fully incorporating it into the dough after each addition.

It might look like a gloopy mess at first, as the butter smears around the bowl. But as the friction of the mixer warms up the fat, it will begin to emulsify.
If the butter starts to clump up around the top of the mixing bowl, turn your mixer off and use a spatula or a bowl scraper to clear it off the sides, and push the dough back down towards the center of the bowl before you continue mixing.
Step 4 – Mix
Once the butter appears to be fully incorporated, turn the mixer up to medium-high speed for three minutes. This will ensure that all of the butter is thoroughly worked into the dough.
This step is important because any hidden pockets of fat will create clumps in the dough when it is chilled.

Brioche is very sturdy, so just as in step two, there is no need to fear a strong mix here.
Step 5 – Pour and Proof
Prepare a container for the bulk fermentation of the dough. I like to use a rectangular, resealable, airtight storage container that has been dusted generously with flour.
Use a container that is big enough to contain at least twice the volume of your dough, as it will nearly double in size during this phase.
Pour the dough into the prepared container. It should be very thin at this stage, almost liquid.
Let the sealed container sit at room temperature for half an hour.
Step 6 – Fold and Chill
Now it’s time to give the dough a final fold before placing it in the refrigerator to chill overnight.
Fold it in half first vertically, then horizontally. The flour in the bottom of the container should make it easy to pick up the dough and fold it.
After folding, seal the lid again or wrap the container tightly with plastic wrap. Place it in the fridge for at least 12 hours, or overnight.
Step 7 – Shape
This is the point when you are able to get creative with your treats.

Hoping to make doughnuts? Shape the dough into two-ounce pieces for frying.
Planning on baking a large loaf? Drop the dough onto the counter and shape it into loaf form.

For some more ideas, be sure to check out our guide to shaping, as well as these delicious brioche-based recipes:

Berliner Jelly-Filled Doughnuts
Baked Doughnuts
Brown Butter Dinner Rolls
Cinnamon Rolls
Chocolate Cinnamon Babka

Step 8 – Proof
Once you’ve shaped your dough, cover it lightly with plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature to proof.
It’s better to give brioche a longer proof at a slightly cooler temperature than it is to risk letting it get too warm.
If the temperature in your kitchen is too high, the butter will begin to melt, hurting the beautiful shaping you just completed.
The shaped dough is ready to bake when you can touch the edge lightly with your fingertip and it slowly returns to its original form.
Step 9 – Bake or Fry
After it’s been proofed, your dough is ready to go. If you’re making doughnuts, they can be dropped into the fryer.
If you are making a loaf, hand pies, rolls, or some other kind of baked bread, bake according to the recipe instructions specific to your treat.
A good general guide is to brush the top with a whisked egg wash and bake at 350°F until the internal temperature reads 180°F on a kitchen thermometer.

Cover pan loosely with plastic wrap and leave at room temperature until almost doubled in size and almost fills the pan, 1-2 hours (rising time will depend on how warm the room is; the warmer it is, the faster it will rise).Preheat oven to 350°F/180°C, making sure to allow plenty of time for it to heat fully before the bread has finished rising.For the glaze beat one large egg with 1 tablespoon of water in a small bowl. Remove plastic wrap from pan, brush the top of the loaf with a thin layer of the glaze, and place the loaf on middle rack of oven. Bake for about 30-35 minutes (if you have a thermometer, the center of the loaf should register 190°F) until cooked through and golden. Allow bread to cool for 20 minutes, then remove from pan and allow to cool completely before slicing.Brioche will stay fresh for 24 hours in an airtight container at room temperature.

23,https://www.artisanbryan.com/post/how-to-make-sourdough-brioche-recipe,"So what makes brioche so fun to make? Is it the soft, warm, and buttery texture? Or the fact that you can do so much with this versatile dough?   The shapes, fillings, and flavors you can create with brioche dough verge on endless. With this recipe, you can shape your dough into buns for burgers, pull-apart bread for the table, savory brioche bites, and sweet cinnamon sugar topped goodies. I've even piped aged balsamic vinegar and pastry cream into this dough (yes, strange I know)...but I'd do it again in a heartbeat.  If you're mixing with a machine, everything including the salt is getting added to the bowl at once. If you're mixing by hand, make sure the butter is extra soft and you will mix the butter in a bit more gradually. It will definitely take a bit longer by hand but it's not a difficult process. It works like a charm, it's quick, and the results are delicious. These are all things that appeal to me. Mostly the delicious part. I also usually only use All-Purpose flour when machine mixing. The addition of bread flour works if you're mixing by hand to help build a stronger gluten structure. What You'll Need (for levain build):100 grams Mature Sourdough Starter50 grams King Arthur Organic Whole Wheat Flour150 grams King Arthur Organic Bread Flour200 grams Warm WaterWhat You'll Need (Final Mix)250 grams King Arthur Organic All-Purpose Flour250 grams King Arthur Organic Bread Flour250 grams Levain115 grams Cold Water175 grams Unsalted Butter175 grams Eggs175 grams Sugar6 grams salt6 grams Honey6 grams Lemon Zest1 gram Vanilla ExtractYou will also need 1 big mixing bowl!Here's What You Need To Do:Cube your butter into chunks and make sure it is soft to the touch before you proceed. Combine all of your ingredients into a big bowl. I like to crack my eggs in a separate bowl, and then add the water to them before adding to the rest of the ingredients.Use your hands to squeeze everything together. It's going to be messy and sticky, so make sure your bowl is big enough to where you aren't making a mess. If you absolutely feel you need to add more flour, now is the time to do it. I would add small amounts at a time, but don't go overboard.  Your hand kneading or machine mixing process, with time, will give you the necessary gluten development! Trust the process. If you are machine mixing, start at the lowest speed and mix for 2 minutes. Crank the machine up to medium speed and mix for 2-3 minutes or until you see the dough start to come together. Let the dough rest for 1 minute, and then switch it to the highest speed setting and let it mix until the dough slaps on the side of the bowl and has a smooth surface. This can take 10-15 minutes. Make sure you don't burn out your little mixer!If you are hand mixing, first add only half of the butter and squeeze until all ingredients are incorporated. Once you have a consistent texture, you can begin to stretch and slap the dough on the table, while slowly incorporating the rest of the butter. It will come apart very easily, but the longer you knead/stretch/slap the dough, the more it will come together. You can give it a few periods of rest (5 or so minutes) to let it come together. Remember: with a machine mix, it takes 15 or so minutes for the dough to come together. If you opt to hand mix brioche, be prepared to knead and develop your dough for at least 30 minutes. Flour your work surface as well, to ensure that your dough doesn't stick too much.Once your dough is fairly smooth on the surface and has come together, place it in a clean and oiled bowl for bulk fermentation. If you hand-mixed, you can give it a couple of stretches and folds every 30 minutes to continue to help the gluten formation process. Allow your dough to go through the initial rise in a warm place for 6 hours. My house temperature is usually between 72-75f.After you notice your dough is smooth and springy to the touch, put it into the fridge overnight to continue developing flavor and a strong structure. I usually will refrigerate it for about 10 hours at 40f. Once you complete the cold stage of your fermentation, remove the dough. Now it's time to get creative! You can divide and shape into whatever shape you want. For buns, I usually divide into 130-gram piece and round them into little balls. You can put them side by side on a baking tray in a 4 x 6 pattern. It's ok for them to proof into each other because they will bake nicely and pull apart. For pull-apart bread in a loaf tin, use 6 110 gram pieces and squeeze together into the pan in two rows of 3. For a braided loaf, divide into your desired size strips and roll them out so that you can braid your loaf.If you want to top your brioche with savory or sweet things, now would be the time to do it. I've used cinnamon sugar, tomatoes, ham and cheese, and pretty much anything I could think of. Be creative here, but remember that plain old brioche is probably the best. Brush your dough with an egg wash and proof for about 4 hours, or until the dough grows noticeably in size and becomes springy to the touch. You'll also start to get a great aroma from the dough.Preheat your oven to 375f, and egg wash your brioche one final time. Bake your brioche for 20-25 minutes. Depending on your oven and color preference you may need to go a bit longer. If you're using convection, 15-20 minutes will usually do.Enjoy your warm sourdough brioche! If you plan to fill your brioche rolls after baking, allow them to cool completely before piping in your filling or cream. ",brioche

There are a lot of different recipes and methods and we tried several of them with varying results. This recipe is a winner with us. It doesn’t take a lot of your time. But it’s a two stage one, so keep in mind you have to plan in advance and start Friday to have your Brioche for Saturday’s brunch. 
Even though it’s a simplified version of the classic French recipe, the taste and texture have convinced us more than the brioches we recently tasted in France. And with brioche freshness is key. You bake it, you eat it. But it’s hard to imagine there will be anything left ones you put it on the table. We like it with fresh butter and raspberry jam.











































Ingredients for the Brioche
makes 1 Brioche loaf 

375 g fine bread flour (we use French Type 55)
60 ml lukewarm milk 
3 large eggs
7 g instant yeast
7 g salt
40 g fine sugar
100 g soft dairy butter


Making the Brioche
This is a two stages recipe because the dough has to rest in the fridge overnight.
First day: Combine flour, salt, sugar and milk in a mixing bowl. Attach the dough hook to your mixer and add yeast, then the eggs one by one and after that the butter in chunks, and mix until you have a smooth and rather sticky dough. Keep mixing for 9 minutes. If you use a KitchenAid use speed 2. Remove the dough from the bowl (do not worry about the stickiness, after a night in the fridge it will be OK) and transfer to a greased bowl, cover with clingfilm and put in the fridge overnight. 
NB: The amount of moisture you have to add to your dough can vary depending on the flour you are using. You can find a lot of information about different flour types (American vs European) and peoples experiences on the internet (The Fresh Loaf, King Arthur).

Second day: Get the dough from the fridge about 30 minutes before you want to shape it so it can acclimatise and it feels OK to handle and shape.  Now you can shape the dough in many ways, a classic brioche (big ball with smaller ball in hole on top) a loaf shape or several small brioches. Or you can make 6 equal sized balls, and arrange them in a bread pan (mine is 26 cm x 13 cm or 10.2 x 5.1 inches), or make a cluster of 8 or 9 balls that fit together in a round tin (see pictures). Cover with floured clingfilm.

Now you have to be patient because the proofing will take about 3.5 hours at room temperature. Preheat your oven at 200º C (390º F). Now adjust  your oven to 190º C (375º F) for the first 10 minutes, then lower to 160º C (320º F) for another 20 minutes. Take the brioche out of the oven and immediately transfer from the pan onto a cooling rack.

I've been wanting to make this delectable version of brioche for some time now, and so it was that a recent online reference to Guy Savoy's new venture in Paris, Gout de Brioche, finally got me going. The shop offers individual as well as ""grand"" brioche feuilletée in a variety of flavors both savory and sweet. 



This particular dough is another in the family of laminated dough - puff pastry, croissant and Danish being the standards.  Here we have an egg enriched brioche dough which is put through similar laminating steps to create buttery, flaky layers of goodness.











It seems that every time I make brioche I look back at various recipes and compare ingredient amounts and ratios.  This time I reviewed the recipe from the Le Nôtre class that I attended in Paris during our recent September trip. Using it, as well as an online recipe attributed to Philippe Conticini of Pâtisserie des Rêves fame, I came up with my own version to launch my attempt at brioche feuilletée.








Brioche dough can be lean to rich and may contain amounts of butter that are anywhere from 20-80% of the quantity of flour in the recipe.  With the laminated approach one reduces the amount of butter in the basic dough but then uses a larger amount of butter for the butter block that becomes incorporated into the dough.





Here's the dough: 500 g flour (450 g all purpose and 50 g bread); 10 g salt; 50 g sugar; 8 g instant yeast; 90 ml whole milk; 250 g egg (about 5 large); 50 g unsalted butter, cut into small cubes.  



Place the flour, salt, sugar, yeast and milk in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook and mix on low for a couple of minutes.  Add the eggs 1-2 at a time until each addition is incorporated.



Increase speed to medium and mix for 12-15 minutes until the dough is coming away from the sides of the bowl.  



Add the butter piece by piece until incorporated. The dough should be shiny, smooth and silky.



Turn the dough out into a lightly greased bowl, cover and let it rise for an hour.















Deflate the dough gently then cover snugly and put into the fridge for 4-5 hours or overnight.



Form a butter block with 340 g unsalted butter and hold it in the fridge overnight as well.



The following morning take the butter out to take the firm chill off and allow it to become more malleable for the beurrage et tourage.



At this point the process is the same as for croissant - envelope the butter and then put it through three single, or business letter, folds with 30 minute rests in between. Here's the first fold.









After the three folds give it a good hour rest in the fridge before rolling it out for its final use.



Take a look at my finished dough below - it felt great even though the butter isn't uniformly distributed in the dough. I pushed on nonetheless!  









Roll the dough out into an approximately 16""x13' rectangle.  At this point you can do any filling your little heart desires.  I opted for a simple mix of crushed raw sugar cubes with lemon zest which I sprinkled over the dough, leaving the upper edge clear.







Brush the upper edge with a little water, milk or egg wash to help seal the seam once you've rolled it up.









Now slice into twelve 1 1/4"" slices.









You can tuck these, cut side up, into buttered standard muffin tins, but I decided to use lightly buttered panettone papers.









Let these rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, depending on your ambient temperature.  They should look poufy with increased prominence of the laminations.















Heat the oven to 400ºF.  



Brush the tops with a bit of egg wash or milk and sprinkle with pearl sugar.














Bake for 10 minutes then decrease the temp to 350 for another 10-15 minutes until nicely browned.









Once cooled a bit I pulled them out of the baking papers and brushed the surface with lemon syrup.  I find that brioche often look a bit dry coming out of the oven and the syrup gives them a nice sheen.







They look a bit like a conch shell!  Or some kind of snail.  Some of them tried to rise up and escape from their houses, looking like a slinky going down the stairs.













Once a bit cooled it was definitely time for a taste test. In the photo below the smaller pieces in the background are a couple of end scraps that I baked separately, and the sliced brioche in the front is one that slink-ied out of its paper.








The thing that always strikes me about a good brioche is how LIGHT it is!  The eggs and the butter don't seem to weigh it down at all.  Although remember that an important part is making sure you give these babies a decent rise - if they don't rise long enough they'll end up heavy and dense.











The flavor and texture were just right and the lemon syrup gave these a nice little zing.  But next time I'd punch the lemon zest up even more.



I can't wait to try some other versions!  Yessiree!!

It's all about the journey.",brioche

This Week’s Recipe

Brioche LoavesThis recipe appears in the ""Brioche"" episode of Martha Bakes.Ingredients5 tablespoons lukewarm milk (100 to 115 degrees)1/2 ounce fresh yeast1 pound 2 ounces all-purpose flour, plus more for forming dough1 tablespoon coarse salt6 large eggs1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) unsalted butter, slightly softened, plus more for molds1/4 cup superfine sugar1 large egg yolk1 tablespoon milkNonstick cooking sprayDirectionsPlace the milk and yeast in a small bowl; stir to dissolve. Place the flour, salt, and eggs in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment; add yeast mixture and mix on low speed to combine and knead, about 5 minutes. Scrape down sides of bowl with a spatula; knead on medium speed until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. In a large bowl, mix together butter and sugar. Add a few small pieces of butter mixture to dough; with the mixer on low, add remaining butter mixture, a little bit at a time. When all the butter mixture has been added, increase speed and continue mixing until smooth, shiny, comes away from the sides of the bowl, and is elastic, 6 to 10 minutes. Butter a large bowl, transfer dough to prepared bowl, and cover with plastic wrap; let stand in a warm place until doubled in volume about 2 hours. Lift dough from bowl and drop back into bowl to deflate; repeat process once or twice. Cover bowl and transfer to refrigerator to chill for at least 8 hours and up to overnight. Butter two loaf pans that measure 8 1/2-by-4 1/2-inches across the top, and 7 1/2-by-3 1/2-inches across the base. Divide dough into 2 equal pieces. Divide each piece of dough into 8 equal pieces; form each piece into a ball. Place 8 balls of dough in each loaf pan, side-by-side. In a small bowl, whisk together egg yolk and milk. Brush dough with egg yolk mixture, reserving remaining. Spray two pieces of plastic wrap with nonstick cooking spray; cover dough in both pans, cooking spray-side down and let stand in a warm place until doubled in volume, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Preheat oven to 400 degrees on a convection oven and 425 degrees on a conventional oven. Brush each loaf very lightly with reserved egg yolk mixture. Transfer pans to oven and bake until brioche just begins to turn golden, about 15 minutes. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees on a convection oven and 375 degrees conventional oven and continue baking until deep golden brown and internal temperature reaches 205 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, 20 to 25 minutes more. Remove from oven and let brioche cool in pans for 5 minutes. Unmold onto a wire rack and let cool completely. Yield: 2 servings

Basic Brioche Dough 
Here’s a standard brioche dough that will make twelve 1.6-ounce brioche à têtes, one single loaf, or a batch of cinnamon (a.k.a. “sticky”) buns. Start by putting into a bowl:
2 tablespoons milk
1 tablespoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon instant yeast
3 ounces all-purpose flour
1 egg

Stir all of it together withe a fork until the mixture is the consistency of a thick batter. 

This is your sponge. Use it right away or, for best flavor, make it a day ahead of time, let it ferment for an hour at room temperature then refrigerate it overnight. When you’re ready to prepare your dough scrape it into the bowl of an electric mixer.

Then whisk together a mixture of:
6 ounces all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons sugar
1 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast
1/2 teaspoon salt 
Like so:

…and sprinkle over the sponge in the mixer bowl. 

Let it sit for 2 hours, 2 1/2 – 3 if the sponge was refrigerated. The dome of dry mix will crack as the sponge expands. It may even bubble through in a few spots. This is good. 

To mix, add two cold eggs and using the dough hook, beat the mixture for 2-3 minutes on medium speed. 

When it gets to looking like so…

…start adding your butter. With the machine running, begin to add 4 ounces of very soft butter. If you want the brioche to rise high, say for a  large brioche loaf, go a little lighter, maybe 2 1/2 ounces. If you’re making something rich like cinnamon rolls, the full four ounces work great. For maximum flavor use an ounce or two of browned butter. Add it a tablespoon at a time, letting the dough absorb each addition before adding another, about two minutes of mixing per tablespoon of butter. 

Notice how light and sticky the dough gets. This is a terrific consistency for something like cinnamon rolls or têtes-de-brioche. Again if you want a higher-rising brioche, keep kneading the dough for another ten minutes or so to develop more structure (gluten). 

Once the dough is uniform (and it might take an extra bowl scraping or two), scrape it into a oiled bowl or rising container.  

Let it rise another 1 1/2 hours until it looks about like so:

Drape a piece of plastic wrap over it and deflate it by gently pressing down on it with your hand.

Put it into the refrigerator, letting it chill for a minimum of two hours, preferably overnight, to firm it (you’ll likely need to deflate it one more time after the first hour or so). For maximum flavor let it ripen for up to  three days in the fridge. It can be frozen for several months.

Set aside.In bowl of stand mixer (or large bowl), measure gluten free flour. Add yeast, sugar, salt, eggs, milk, and vinegar and mix on low speed until smooth.Add butter 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing for 20 seconds between each addition. The dough should be smooth and about the consistency of a thick frosting. If making in a muffin tin, divide dough evenly to make 12 rolls and smooth the tops with a spatula. If making in brioche molds, sprinkle 2-3 tablespoons of gluten free flour onto the counter and coat dough in the flour so it's workable. Don't mix the flour into the dough, and only use as much as you need. The more flour you use, the more dense your dough will be and the harder it will be for it to rise.Divide dough into 12 equal pieces. Reserve a small section of each piece to make the traditional topknot, it will be a ball about 1/2 inch in diameter.Place each of the 12 larger pieces into brioche molds, and smooth tops. Make a small indent in the center of each and place the 1/2"" ball in the indentation of each roll. Cover loosely with greased plastic wrap or a proofing bag, and let rise in a warm, draft-free area for 15-20 minutes until about doubled in size.Bake at 350 for 15-20 minutes until they are done. Traditional brioche will be a dark brown color, but gluten free flours don't produce that kind of color, so don't wait until they're brown ;)These rolls are best served fresh, but can be frozen and warmed in the microwave.",brioche

Add the sugar and let stand until the yeast gives off some moisture, about 3 minutes. Whisk well to dissolve. Add the cold milk and yolks and whisk to combine.   

If using active dry yeast, sprinkle the yeast over 1/3 cup warm, 105° to 115°F (40° to 46°C) milk in a small bowl. Let stand until softened, about 5 minutes, then stir to dissolve. Add to the mixer bowl along with 1 tablespoon cold milk, the sugar, and yolks, and whisk to combine.Attach the bowl to the mixer and fit with the paddle attachment. With the machine on low speed, add 2 cups of the flour and the salt. Mix until the mixture forms a sticky, batter-like dough that clings to the sides of the bowl.Increase the speed to medium. Beat in the softened butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, letting each addition become absorbed before adding another. Remove the paddle attachment.Using a spatula, scrape the dough into the center of the bowl. Attach the dough hook to the mixer. Knead the dough on medium-high speed until it is gathers into a ball around the hook. Return to medium speed and knead, adding tablespoons of the remaining flour, until the dough is smooth but feels tacky and sticks to the bottom of the bowl, about 3 minutes.Generously butter a medium bowl. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Gently shape into a ball. Turn the ball, smooth side down, in the bowl, and turn right side up to lightly coat the ball in butter. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let stand in a warm place until doubled, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.Butter twelve 3 1/2-inch-wide brioche tins. Carefully turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface, but do not punch it down—its texture should remind you of a feather-filled pillow. Cut the dough into 12 equal portions. (If you have a kitchen scale, each portion will weigh 2 ounces.)One at a time, shape each portion into a ball on the work surface, taking care not to break the exterior of the dough. To do this, cup both hands around the dough. Carefully turn the dough in your cupped hands to gently shape it into a ball—overhandling will soften the butter too much. Place the dough on its side, with the rough underside facing one side. Lightly dust the side of your hand with flour. Place the side of your hand about 1 inch from the smooth end of the dough. Using the upper part of your hand, including the last finger, move your hand back and forth to cut into the dough, forming a small ball that is attached to the larger portion by a thin strand.Transfer the shaped dough to a brioche tin, holding the larger portion in one hand and the small ball in the other, taking care not to break the connection. Place the larger portion of dough in the bottom of the tin. Using your thumb and first two fingers, still holding the small ball of dough, force a hole into the center of the larger portion of dough, reaching all the way down to the bottom of the tin, and stick the smaller ball in the hole. This keeps it from popping off during baking. Repeat with the remaining balls of dough. Place the tins on a half-sheet pan. Lightly brush the tops of the brioche with some of the beaten egg, reserving the rest.Choose a warm spot in the kitchen for proofing. Slip the half-sheet pan into a tall “kitchen-sized” plastic bag. Place two tall glasses of very hot water near the center of the pan. Wave the opening of the bag to trap air and inflate the bag like a balloon to create “head room,” being sure that the plastic does not touch the sticky dough. Twist the bag closed. Let stand in a warm place until the brioche looks puffy, about 1 hour.Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350°F (176°C). Remove the glasses from the bag, and then the pan. Lightly brush the tops of the brioche again with the reserved egg. Bake until the brioche are golden brown, about 20 minutes.Let the brioche cool in their tins for 5 minutes. Remove the brioche from their tins and serve warm or at room temperature. (Leftover brioche—if there are any—can be frozen for up to 2 weeks. They&#8217;re terrific toasted.)

Pour the warm milk into the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment (or you can use a handheld mixer or no mixer, but a stand mixer is ideal). Manually whisk in the yeast and 2 teaspoons of the granulated sugar. Cover the bowl with a clean towel. The mixture should be frothy and foamy after 5 minutes.On low speed, beat in the remaining sugar and the softened butter until butter is slightly broken up. Next beat in 1 whole egg plus 1 egg yolk (reserve the egg white) and the salt. The butter won&#8217;t really be mixing in, so don&#8217;t be alarmed if it stays in pieces. On low speed, gradually add the flour. Once it is all added, beat on medium speed until a soft dough forms, about 1 minute.Increase speed to medium-high and beat until the dough is soft and supple and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 6 minutes. If you do not have a stand-mixer with a dough hook attachment, knead the dough by hand in this step.Turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and form into a ball. Place into a large greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. (I just use the same mixing bowl that I made the dough in&#8211; remove the dough, grease it with nonstick spray or olive oil, put the dough back in.) Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in a warm environment to rise until doubled, about 90 minutes. For this warm environment, I preheat the oven to 200°F (93°C) then turn the oven off and place the bowl inside the warm-ish oven. Leave the oven door cracked a bit.Once doubled in size, punch down the dough to release any air bubbles. Remove dough from the bowl and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Punch down again to release any more air bubbles if needed. Using a sharp knife or dough scraper, cut dough in half. Work with only half of the dough at a time. Place a clean towel over the dough you aren&#8217;t working with.Generously grease two 9&#215;5 inch loaf pans with butter or nonstick spray.On slightly floured work surface, roll one dough half out into a 9&#215;13 inch rectangle (approximately). Spread with 1 cup of Nutella, leaving a 1/2 inch border uncovered.Watch the video above to see exactly how I do this step. Tightly roll the dough into a 13-inch log. Place the log on its seam. Using a sharp knife, cut the log in half lengthwise. I find a serrated knife works best. Criss-cross one half, cut side down, on top of the other half&#8211; forming an X. Twist the two together. Place in prepared loaf pan and cover with a clean towel. Repeat with 2nd half of dough. This step can get a little messy!Allow both shaped (and covered) loaves to rest for 10-20 minutes as you prepare the crumble topping and preheat the oven.Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C).Mix the brown sugar, flour, and cinnamon together in a medium bowl. Using a pastry cutter, cut the cold butter into the brown sugar mixture until coarse crumbs are formed. Set aside.Whisk the remaining 2 Tablespoons of milk with the leftover egg white. This is your egg wash. Using a pastry brush, brush the babka loaves with egg wash. Do the best you can as some Nutella is exposed. Top each loaf with crumble topping.Bake for 45-50 minutes or until babka is golden brown on top. Remove from the oven, place each pan on a wire rack, and allow to cool for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.Cover and store leftover babka at room temperature for a couple days or in the refrigerator for 1 week. (It won&#8217;t last that long!!) You can also freeze the baked babka for up to 3 months, then thaw overnight in the refrigerator. Bring to room temperature before serving.

44,https://www.cookstr.com/recipes/Classic-Brioche," In the bowl of a stand mixer, or a large mixing bowl if preparing the dough by hand, sprinkle the yeast over the warm milk. Stir in the 1½ teaspoons of sugar and let the yeast proof for 5 to 7 minutes, until foamy and bubbling. Add 1 cup flour and the salt, beating with the paddle attachment or a wooden spoon to make a soft, smooth batter, about 5 minutes. Beat in the remaining 4½ cups flour and the 6 tablespoons sugar in three additions, beating in 2 eggs after each addition of flour. Mix well between additions, making sure you scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl. Beat until a smooth, soft and elastic dough is formed, about 10 minutes with the dough hook attachment, or 20 to 25 minutes by hand. I actually like to turn the dough out of the mixer at this point and hand-knead. The technique is simple (and great for relieving stress—cheaper than a therapist!). Slap the dough onto the counter, then with the heel of one hand push it through the middle into the counter. With the other hand, fold the far side of the blob towards you, over onto itself, and rotate the dough about 90 degrees. Repeat this pushing, folding and rotating cycle several times, then give the dough another good hard slap onto the counter. (Don’t add any extra flour at this point, even if the dough feels sticky; just use a dough scraper to gather the dough off the work surface. As the dough becomes more elastic, it will lose its gumminess and become smooth.) Do a stretch test: pinch some of the dough and pull it upwards. When the dough is ready, it should feel springy and elastic. If you have removed your dough from the stand mixer, return it to a clean mixer bowl. If you are preparing the dough entirely by hand, you may find the next step easier in a large mixing bowl with a wooden spoon. Knead or beat the butter into the dough in small portions, fully incorporating each addition before adding the next. This process is definitely easier with a dough hook, but it is not impossible by hand. Squeeze the first few additions of butter through the dough, kneading until it is absorbed, then use a wooden spoon to beat in the remaining additions to prevent the dough from getting greasy and slippery, a sign that the butter is melting and not getting properly incorporated. The butter should be malleable, but not overly soft, and the dough should not get too warm during this process. When the last of the butter has been beaten in, continue beating the dough until it is very smooth, glossy and elastic, about 5 minutes with the dough hook, or 10 minutes by hand. The dough should now have reached the “clean-up stage”—it should come away from the sides of the bowl in a smooth entity, or should neatly roll on the counter, no longer sticky or tacky. Transfer the dough to a large, lightly buttered bowl and cover the bowl with a sheet of plastic wrap. Leave to rise at warm room temperature, away from any draughts (about 75 degrees is perfect), until doubled in bulk, about 1¼ to 2 hours. Punch the dough down and flip it over, deflating it completely. The buttery side should now be facing up. Cover again with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours. Punch the dough down, flip it once more, cover the bowl with plastic and weigh it down with a plate or dish, making sure the dough won’t be able to creep around the sides of the weight and escape the confines of its bowl. (I have seen renegade doughs running rampant over the bottles and jars on refrigerator shelves more than once, and it’s not a mess that you will forget having to clean up! Not to mention the waste of time, energy and perfectly good butter.) Return the bowl to the coldest part of your refrigerator and leave there overnight. If the dough is left longer than 8 hours, check periodically to make sure it has not risen above the bowl; gently punch it down as necessary. The brioche dough may be frozen at this point, wrapped very securely. Allow the dough to thaw in the refrigerator for 4 to 7 hours, then proceed with the shaping, final rising and baking. Several hours before you plan to bake the brioche, remove the dough from the refrigerator, punch it down and turn it out onto a very lightly floured surface. Invert the bowl over the dough and let the dough rest for 10 minutes. (At this point, the dough can be shaped for other pastries as well.) Meanwhile, butter two 9 × 5-inch metal loaf pans, or two 8-inch fluted brioche moulds (or one of each!) and set aside. To form two 9 × 5-inch loaves: divide the dough into 6 roughly equal parts and cover 5 of these with plastic wrap to prevent them from drying out. Roll the remaining portion on the counter into a smooth ball, plumping it by caressing the sides of it with your hands from top to bottom, pulling the surface taut and smooth and tucking the excess dough underneath the ball. Set the ball in the end of one of the prepared loaf pans and cover it with plastic while you repeat the process with the remaining pieces of dough. Place 3 balls in each pan, In a row. To form two 8-inch brioche a tetes: divide the dough into 2 equal portions. Cover 1 portion with plastic wrap while you work with the other. Divide this half into 8 relatively equal portions, then cover 7 of them with plastic. Roll the remaining portion on the counter into a smooth ball as for the 9 × 5-inch loaves above. Place this ball in the bottom of one of the prepared fluted moulds. Repeat the rolling process with 6 of the remaining pieces of dough, setting them around the outside of the mould over the first ball. Roll the last piece into a smooth ball and nestle this into the centre of the circle of balls. Cover the pan loosely with plastic wrap and repeat with the second half of the dough. Cover the pans loosely with plastic and drape a dishtowel over top. Let the shaped loaves rise in a draught-free place until plumped and risen, but not quite doubled. This last rising can take between 1½ to 2½ hours, as the dough is still chilled from the refrigerator. Keep an eye on the dough and make sure that it does not rise too much, or you will not get as good an oven-spring (the big initial rising in the oven).. During the last 20 minutes of the final rising, preheat the oven to between 375° and 400°. Brush the plump loaves with the egg-milk glaze and bake them for 35 to 40 minutes, or until they sound hollow when tipped out of their pans and tapped on the bottom. Be careful when handling the hot loaves, as the joints between the sections are still very soft and fragile. As the brioche cools, the loaves will become firm and less delicate.. Turn the loaves out and cool completely on wire racks before serving or wrapping tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil and storing or freezing. The baked brioche can be frozen for up to 2 months, well-wrapped. Thaw at room temperature for about 4 hours.",brioche
