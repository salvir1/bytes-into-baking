Run your fingers down the center to create a trough. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of water into the trough. Quickly fluff the dough with your fingers, keeping your fingers loose and using a scooping motion. Gather the flour back in to a mound, create a trough, and add another tablespoon of water. Continue sprinkling and fluffing until the flour clumps together in large pieces and holds together when pressed.Chill the dough: Press the dough into a square and wrap in plastic. It&#x27;s fine if it looks a little shaggy and unkempt at this stage. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.Prepare the butter block: Cut the butter into a few large pieces and sprinkle with a teaspoon of flour. Begin pounding the butter with a French rolling pin to soften it, sprinkling flour on your rolling pin as needed. Pound the butter flat, then use a pastry scraper to gather it up again. Sprinkle with another teaspoon of flour, pound flat, and repeat. Add one more teaspoon of flour, then continue pounding and gathering, pounding and gathering, until the butter is very pliable and does not break when you fold it over on itself.Chill the butter block: Once the butter is pliable, shape it into a 4-inch x 4-inch square, wrap in plastic, and chill 10 minutes (no longer).Roll out the lean dough: Remove the dough from the fridge and roll out to a roughly 7-inch square.Wrap the butter in the dough: Place the square of butter on top of the dough at a 90-degree angle to the dough. Fold the corners of the dough over the butter so they meet in the middle. Pinch to seal.First turn: Flour the work surface lightly and flip the butter package over so the seams are down. Roll it out to a rectangle roughly 12 inches long by 6 inches wide.

Wrap in plastic and chill for 30 minutes.Perform two final turns: Repeat rolling and folding the dough two more times for a total of six turns. By this point, the dough should feel completely smooth and be easy to roll out.Chill for 1 hour or overnight: Wrap in plastic and chill for a final 60 minutes, or overnight.Roll and cut the dough: When ready to bake, begin the oven preheating to 425°F. Roll out the puff pastry dough to between 1/4 and 1/8 inches thick. Use the dough as is to make a large tart, or cut the dough into whatever shapes you need.

Add just enough ice water so that if you pinch the dough it will hold its shape and not fall apart (see photos in post, the dough will otherwise be quite shaggy). If the mixture is still dry and crumbly and not sticking to itself when pressed after you have added 8 Tablespoons, add additional water one tablespoon at a time. Take care to not overwork the dough or it will be tough.Once the dough is clinging together when pinched, it will still be quite shaggy.

15,https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/danish-pastry-dough/,"To help guarantee success, I recommend reading through the recipe, watching the video tutorial, and reading the explanations below this recipe. (All answer many FAQs.) Do not use an electric mixer for this dough. It&#8217;s best if the dough is folded together with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula since it is so sticky. There is very minimal mixing required.Whisk the warm water, yeast, and 1 Tablespoon (6g) of sugar together in a large bowl. Cover and allow to rest until foamy on top, about 5 minutes. If the surface doesn&#8217;t have bubbles on top or look foamy after 15 minutes (it should if the yeast isn&#8217;t expired), start over with a fresh packet of yeast. Whisk in remaining sugar, the milk, egg, and salt. Once these wet ingredients are mixed together, lightly cover and set the bowl aside as you work on the next step.Cut the cold butter into 1/4 inch slices and add to a food processor or blender. Top with 2 and 1/2 cups flour. Pulse the mixture 12-15 times, until butter is crumbled into pea-size bits. See photo below for a visual. Using a food processor or blender is best for this dough. Keeping that in mind, if you don&#8217;t have one, you can use a pastry cutter to work in the butter.Pour the flour mixture into the wet yeast mixture. Very gently fold everything together using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Fold *just until* the dry ingredients are moistened. The butter must remain in pieces and crumbles, which creates a flaky pastry. Turn the sticky dough out onto a large piece of plastic wrap, parchment paper, aluminum foil, or into any container you can tightly cover.Wrap the dough/cover up tightly and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 48 hours.Take the dough out of the refrigerator to begin the “rolling and folding” process. If the dough sat for more than 4 hours, it may have slightly puffed up and that&#8217;s ok. (It will deflate as you shape it, which is also ok.) Very generously flour a work surface. The dough is very sticky, so make sure you have more flour nearby as you roll and fold. Using the palm of your hands, gently flatten the dough into a small square. Using a rolling pin, roll out into a 15&#215;8 inch rectangle. When needed, flour the work surface and dough as you are rolling. Fold the dough into thirds as if it were a business letter. (See photos and video tutorial.) Turn it clockwise and roll it out into a 15 inch long rectangle again. Then, fold into thirds again. Turn it clockwise. You’ll repeat rolling and folding 1 more time for a total of 3 times.Wrap up/seal tightly and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. You can also freeze the dough at this point. See freezing instructions.Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Rimmed baking sheets are best because butter may leak from the dough as it bakes. If you don&#8217;t have rimmed baking sheets, when it&#8217;s time to preheat the oven, place another baking sheet on the oven rack below to catch any butter that may drip.Take the dough out of the refrigerator and cut it in half. Wrap 1 half up and keep refrigerated as you work with the first half. (You can freeze half of the dough at this point, use the freezing instructions below.)On a floured work surface, roll dough out into a 12&#215;8 inch rectangle. You can roll out the dough on a lightly floured piece of parchment paper or lightly floured silicone baking mat instead because you will transfer the shaped dough to a lined baking sheet next.Using a sharp knife, cut off two corners of the dough (on one 8-inch side) and then two small triangles 3 inches apart from each other on the other end (the other 8-inch side). See visual below.Spread 1/2 of the filling (raspberry or cream cheese) down the length of the center of the strip, which should be about 3 inches wide. Using a sharp knife, pastry wheel, or pizza cutter, cut 10 slanting strips (3/4 &#8211; 1 inch wide each) along both sides. Fold strips over filling, alternating each side to resemble a twist or a braid. Fold the bottom end up to seal the filling inside. Repeat with the second half of the dough and the rest of the filling. The braids may seem very narrow, but they puff up and out as they bake.Whisk the egg wash ingredients together. Brush all over the dough.I strongly recommend refrigerating the shaped braids before baking for at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour before baking. The braids tend to leak more butter and/or lose more shape if they haven&#8217;t chilled.Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C).Bake each braid for 18-22 minutes or until golden brown. Some butter may leak from the dough, that&#8217;s completely normal and expected. Feel free to remove the baking sheets from the oven halfway through baking and brush the dough with any of the leaking butter, then place back in the oven to finish baking. (That&#8217;s what I do!)Remove baked danish braids from the oven and cool for at least 5 minutes before cutting and serving.",puff_pastry

Making vegan puff pastry dough from scratch is easier than you think using this fool-proof cheat method. Enjoy some crispy, flaky goodness in half the time!

Traditional puff pastry is made by encasing a slab of butter in a basic dough made with flour, water, butter and salt. Then the block is rolled and folded at least 4 times, chilling for 30 minutes between each fold.
The whole process takes at least 4 hours!
To cut down on the lengthy process, I used a technique that includes folding in shreds of frozen vegan butter between layers of dough. The dough is then rested for an hour then rolled and folded twice with a final 15 minutes resting time.

The method was adapted from Paul Hollywood’s recipe for quick puff pastry. By using frozen instead of just chilled vegan butter, this allows more time to roll and fold the pastry dough without chilling too many times.
The dough may not rise as high as puff pastry made using the traditional method but the result is just as crispy, flaky and satisfying. 
Homemade pastry is also cheaper than storebought and it only requires 4 ingredients! Here are some FAQs and answers to help you along the way:
Can I use solid coconut oil to make vegan puff pastry?
Personally I haven’t tried using coconut oil to make vegan puff pastry. Although coconut oil solidifies when it’s cold, it also melts rather quickly at room temperature.
Currently, I live in the Caribbean where it’s warm pretty much all year round. Coconut oil would be difficult to work with as it could melt rather quickly during the rolling and folding steps.
It’s key to keep the butter as cold and solid as possible while making the dough. While baking, the solid pieces of vegan butter will melt releasing steam, causing the pastry to rise or “puff up”. This also leaves tiny pockets throughout the layers of dough, giving it the desired flakiness.

I recommend using a stick form of vegan butter. Earth Balance Vegan Buttery Sticks would work well in this recipe. Don’t go for spreadable vegan butter or margarine. They have a higher amount of water which could result in a less flaky and more gummy or tougher result.
At what temperature should I bake vegan puff pastry?
The temperature used to bake puff pastry depends on the individual recipe. Generally, it needs to be baked at a high temperature (400°F/205°C) for about 10 minutes for best results. 
The high temperature allows the butter to melt and release steam quickly to rise the pastry before the dough sets up. 
At a lower temperature, the pastry will fall flat, squeezing out the butter which could result in a tougher, oily mess. Be sure to preheat the oven and try not to open the oven door while baking.

How to store flaky pastry dough
Wrap puff pastry dough airtight in plastic wrap or place in a zip lock bag and store in the fridge for up to 2 days or in the freezer for up to 2 months. 
When ready to use, thaw in the fridge overnight or at room temperature for about 20 to 30 minutes until it is pliable enough to roll out. 
If the pastry dough is too cold, it will crack while rolling. If it is too warm, the butter will melt and it may not rise well while baking.
How much pastry dough does this recipe make?
This recipe makes a little over 500g/1lb of dairy-free puff pastry dough. This should be enough for two 9-inch top pie crusts. I used this dough to top my Vegan Mushroom Pot Pie. The flaky pastry paired with the rich, creamy filling makes it quite a treat!
I wouldn’t recommend using puff pastry as a base for large, filled pies such as apple pie, as the filling could weigh down the base and not allow it to rise as much. This defeats the purpose of creating all those layers in the folding step.
What can I do with leftover pastry dough?
Leftover puff pastry dough can be baked and eaten as a snack served plain or with a dip. You can even sprinkle them with shredded vegan cheese, garlic butter and herbs or cinnamon sugar.
I HIGHLY recommend watching the recipe video which shows the whole process from start to finish. It’s inside the printable recipe card. Just scroll down!

Author: Jhanelle Golding

Ingredients1 stick vegan butter, (½ cup/113g – frozen)2 cups all-purpose flour, (250g)1 tsp salt, (5g)2 tbsp softened vegan butter, (30g)½ cup plus 1 tbsp water, (130ml)
InstructionsGrab a box grater and using the largest side, shred the frozen vegan butter onto a plate. Place in the freezer while you make the dough.In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Then add the softened vegan butter, mixing with a fork until it resembles breadcrumbs.Gradually stir in the water and continue mixing until all the flour starts to come together. You can use your hands at this point to help form the dough. It will look dry at first but keep pressing the dough together until the bowl looks fairly clean.Lightly flour a clean surface and knead the dough, using your hands, for about 4 minutes until it is soft and smooth. Shape into a ball and cover with plastic wrap. Rest in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.Roll out the dough into a rectangle about a 1/4 inch/6mm thick. Remove the vegan butter shreds from the freezer.  Lightly dust your fingertips with flour and add half the shreds to 2/3 of the dough. Add the remaining butter shreds back into the freezer.Fold over the top third of the dough (without any butter shreds) then fold the bottom third, forming a wallet fold. Always brush away any excess flour while folding to help create a lighter product. Make a 1/4 turn with the dough and roll lengthwise into the shape of a rectangle about a 1/4 inch/6mm thick. Add the remaining vegan butter shreds to 2/3 of the dough and repeat the wallet folding step.Seal the openings to keep the butter shreds from falling out of the dough then cover with plastic wrap and rest in the fridge for at least 1 hour. It can also be left overnight.Once rested, repeat the rolling and folding step twice to create more layers in the dough. Then wrap the dough with plastic wrap and rest in the fridge for at least 15 minutes.At this point, the dough the ready for use but if you’d like to create even more flaky layers, you can repeat the rolling and folding step two more times, then rest for another 15 minutes. I used this dough to top my Vegan Mushroom Pot Pie and it worked really well!

Scrape this dough into a flat square about 1 inch thick. The square should measure about 5 inches by 5 inches. Wrap well in plastic, and chill for at least 30 minutes.In a large bowl, combine remaining flour with the salt. Gradually add the cream and mix until a rough dough is formed; it should not be sticky. Do not overmix. Roll the dough into a rectangle, about 12 inches by 7 inches, wrap in plastic, and chill, at least 30 minutes.Remove the flour dough from the refrigerator and place on a lightly floured work surface. Place the butter square at the bottom edge of the rectangle, and fold the flour dough over to completely encase the butter, sealing the edges by pinching them together and forming tight hospital corners at the edges. Wrap well in plastic and chill for at least 30 minutes.Remove the dough from the refrigerator. On a lightly floured board, gently pound the dough all over in regular intervals with a rolling pin. Working in only one direction (lengthwise), gently roll the dough into a 20-by-9-inch rectangle, squaring corners with a bench scraper and your hands as you go. Using a dry pastry brush, sweep off excess flour. With a short side facing you, fold the rectangle in thirds like a business letter, aligning the edges carefully and keeping each edge square. Turn the dough a quarter-turn clockwise, so the flap opening faces right, like a book. This completes the first turn. Pound across the dough, again in regular intervals, and roll out again to a 20-by-9-inch rectangle, rolling in the same lengthwise direction. Fold dough again into thirds. This completes the second turn. Wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate until well chilled, about 1 hour.Repeat the rolling, turning, and chilling process for a total of six turns; always start each turn with the opening of the dough to the right, and always make your tri-fold in the same manner, that is, by starting from either the top of the dough or the bottom each time. By the sixth and final turn, the dough should be very smooth, with no lumps of butter visible. Use as little flour as possible for the rolling, and brush off any excess before folding the dough. If the dough becomes too elastic or too warm to work with, return it to the refrigerator until firm.Wrap the finished dough in plastic and refrigerate until ready to use, at least 2 hours after your final turn, or freeze for future use.",puff_pastry
22,https://leitesculinaria.com/98423/recipes-quick-puff-pastry.html,"In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. Toss the butter in the bowl and immediately stash the bowl in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes.Once the ingredients are chilled, quickly separate the chunks of butter from one another with your fingertips. Use a table knife or pastry blender briefly to cut the butter into the flour, just enough to coat the butter with flour.Turn the contents of the bowl onto a clean work surface—preferably a marble board or metal counter. (A chilled rimmed baking sheet placed upside down on a damp dish towel works well, too. The cold surface will keep the butter from plummeting in temperature.) Form a well in the middle of the pile of flour and butter and dribble in 2 to 3 tablespoons ice water. Quickly mix the water into the flour mixture with your fingertips (spread your fingers a bit apart, as if you were using your hand as a whisk). You can test the mixture by gently squeezing a small handful. The dough should hold together without crumbling. If it doesn’t, keep dribbling in water, 2 to 3 tablespoons at a time, until the dough starts to form. Remember to work quickly and to use your fingertips only.Briskly knead the dough onto itself for 15 seconds until it holds together.Using a bench or dough scraper or your hands, form the dough into a roughly 4-by-4-inch (10-by-10-centimeter) square. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate it until firm, about 30 minutes. Then roll the dough out into a 15-by-8-inch (38-by-20-centimeter) rectangle. Fold the short ends over the middle, as if you were folding a letter, to create 3 layers. This is the first fold.Rotate the entire rectangle of dough 90 degrees and flip it over so the seam side (or what was the top fold) is facing down. Roll the dough away from you (not side to side) into a 15-by-4-inch (38-by-10-centimeter) rectangle. Fold the short ends over the middle to create 3 layers again. This is the second fold.Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for 30 minutes. (If it isn’t hot and humid in your kitchen and you’re working quickly, you can skip this refrigeration step and immediately continue with the recipe.)Repeat the process of folding and rotating the dough to create the third and fourth folds. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for at least 30 minutes and up to 3 days before using it. (You can freeze the dough for up to 2 months. Just wrap it well in plastic wrap and place it in a freezer-safe resealable plastic bag before tossing it in the freezer. Thaw it out in the refrigerator before using.)",puff_pastry

Blitz Puff Pastry Recipe & Video





Printer Friendly Page














    Homemade puff pastry is such a treat. Lots of flaky layers of buttery crisp 
    pastry. Unfortunately it seems to  be something that people are a 
    little hesitant to make at home. I 
    want to change that by offering you this recipe for Blitz Puff Pastry or 
    Quick Puff Pastry, a puff pastry that is easier to make 
    then the classic (traditional) puff pastry. Yes, the first time you 
    make homemade puff pastry it can seem a little complicated, with all that 
    rolling and folding and chilling. Technique is important but it's not 
    hard to master. And while it does take about three hours 
    start to finish, most of that is not hands-on work, it is letting the dough 
    chill in the refrigerator. 








    Blitz Puff Pastry is perfect for making galettes, tarts, turnovers, cheese 
    straws, and even Napoleons. It uses the same basic ingredients as the 
    classic puff pastry, that is, butter, flour, 
    and water (no leavening agent is added). The difference is how they are put 
    together. With the classic puff pastry you have a sheet of dough which you 
    wrap around a block of butter (like a croissant dough). Conversely, with the 
    Blitz Puff Pastry you incorporate the butter right into the flour, like you 
    would when you make a pie dough. But with both types of puff you do roll 
    and fold the dough several times (called lamination). Then, during baking, the 
    ""puff"" happens when the butter melts and creates steam, which pushes the 
    dough upwards, giving you all those wonderful flaky layers.

      
A few things to keep in mind when making 
      puff pastry. First, time is needed to make this dough. For Blitz Puff 
      Pastry the dough needs to be rolled and folded four to five times, and you 
      need to chill the dough between each roll and fold. Now, if you notice the 
      pastry getting too warm when rolling, stop and return the dough to the 
      refrigerator until firm. Because if it gets too warm, it will cause the 
      butter to melt into the dough which will affect the texture of the 
      finished product. Also, if you find your dough is getting too 
      soft or overly sticky when rolling, again stop and chill the dough until 
      it becomes firm.  And if you find the dough is springing back (shrinking) 
      when rolling, again return the dough to the refrigerator and let it chill, 
      which will relax the gluten and make it easier to roll.

Blitz Puff Pastry: 
          In the bowl of your electric stand mixer, fitted with the paddle 
          attachment, beat to combine the flour, malt powder, and salt. Add the 
          cold cubes of butter and beat, on low speed, until the butter is about 
          marble size and the mixture is grainy (about 1-2 minutes). Add the 
          lemon juice and most of the water and beat, on low speed, until the 
          flour is moistened and the dough is shaggy and barely holds together 
          (you do not want a ball of dough). Add more water if needed. (The 
          finished dough will feel dry and will barely hold together when 
          pinched.)
Lamination: Transfer to a lightly floured surface, sprinkle the 
          top of the dough lightly with flour. With a floured rolling pin roll 
          the dough vertically until the length is three times the width (about 
          18 x 6 inches (45 x 15 cm)). Apply even pressure when rolling the 
          dough and lift the dough frequently as you roll so the dough doesn't 
          stick to your counter. Flour as necessary. Roll end to end, not side 
          to side, making sure the dough is of even thickness. When it's at the 
          correct length and width, fold the dough lengthwise into thirds, like 
          you're folding a letter. Make sure the edges of the dough are straight 
          and even. You now have your first turn. 
          Gently wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm 
          (about 30 to 60 minutes).
Second Turn: Place the 
chilled dough on a lightly floured surface so the folded edge is on your left 
(like the binding of a book). Repeat the process of rolling your dough to 18 x 6 
inches (45 x 15 cm) and fold the dough again into thirds. This is now your 
second turn. Gently wrap the dough in plastic wrap and 
refrigerate until firm (about 30 - 60 minutes).
Third and Fourth Turn: Take the 
chilled dough and repeat the rolling and folding into thirds, two more times. 
Chill the dough about 30 to 60 minutes between turns. This 
is your third and fourth turn. 
After the fourth turn check the 
dough. If there are  visible streaks of butter then you will need to do a 
fifth turn. The dough is properly laminated when there are no visible streaks of 
butter and the dough is nice and smooth. At this point the puff pastry needs to be 
chilled several hours before using. Well wrapped, the puff pastry can be 
stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or frozen for about 3 months. 
Defrost the pastry in the refrigerator overnight.

Rough Puff Pastry Recipe – Hints and Tips
Use plain flour (all-purpose or weak flour) for this recipe, plain flour has less gluten than bread flour, which will help make the pastry soft and flaky.
Prepare the butter
The butter must be chilled before starting.Grate the butter or use a vegetable peeler to shave it into thin pieces. Having the butter grated and well chilled makes it easier to work into the dough.Weigh the chilled butter after grating into three portions, one at 60 grams, and the other two at 100 grams each. Then place the weighed butter portions back in the fridge until needed. If the butter is weighed before grating, you will lose some of the butter weight after grating, because some of it will stick to the grater.You can use either salted or unsalted butter for the recipe. 
When making the dough
Refrigerate the dough as indicated in the step by step instructions. Working with a chilled dough is easier to work with.If at any time the dough is breaking up or becoming too soft to work with, put it in the fridge for about 15 minutes or until it has firmed up.When you are more experienced in making the dough, you could skip some or all of the chilling times.
About the water
Use very cold water, it can be straight from the fridge, or add a few ice blocks to the water and allow it to chill before measuring.
Please read the above tips before starting the recipe.
How to Make Rough Puff Pastry Step By Step
Don’t be put off with all the steps below. This recipe is not complicated and once you are familiar with the process an know what to expect, this recipe can be made in less than 30 minutes.
1. Making and shaping the dough
Making the dough

1.  In a bowl add 60 grams of cold grated butter to the flour.
2. Use your fingertips to quickly work the butter into the flour, until it looks like coarse breadcrumbs.
3. Add about 150 ml of chilled water and mix together with your hand, until it just comes together.
Tip: The amount of water that is needed can vary, depending on the flour and temperature of the day. So, you could end up using a little less or a little more water.
4. The dough should be firm and not sticky to the touch and still feel cold.

5 and 6. Place the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about a minute. The kneading will make the dough smoother and less crumbly, making it easier to roll.

7. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for 5 minutes.
 Refrigerate for 5 – 10 minutes.
Tip: The dough can be refrigerated for longer if the butter has softened and become warm, which can happen in hot conditions. Chill the dough for at least 15 – 20 minutes before moving on to the next steps.
Tips for shaping the dough and how to fold rough puff pastry.

8. Use your hands to shape the dough into a rectangle, placing it onto a light floured surface, in a lengthwise direction facing you.
9. Use a rolling pin, roll the dough in a lengthwise direction to increase the length slightly.
10. Then change the direction of the rolling pin to widen the dough slightly.
11. Repeat these steps several times (rolling more in the lengthwise direction) until the dough measures about 39 cm long and 18 cm wide. The edges of the dough should be reasonably straight and even, see steps 12 – 15 on how to achieve this.
Tip: When rolling the dough, lift it occasionally from the bench and dust underneath with a little flour, this will stop it from sticking to the surface. 

12 – 15. As you roll the dough, stop every so often and use your hands to push in the edges of the dough straight. Continue rolling and straightening the edges until the dough measure about 39 cm long and 18 cm wide.
2. First Lamination – Folding With Butter

16. Use a ruler to measure and lightly mark the dough about one third of the way up from the bottom edge.
17. Use your fingers to spread 100 grams of chilled butter onto the top two thirds of the pastry, and gently press it down.
18. Fold the lower one third up onto the grated butter in the centre.
19. Then fold the top one third over the top.  Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for 5 – 10 minutes.
Side view of pastry after the first fold.
 Refrigerate for 5 – 10 minutes.
3. Second Lamination – Folding With Butter
Before rolling the dough, turn the dough so that the smooth surface is facing up and it’s in a lengthwise direction as pictured below.

The second lamination and folding follows the same process as the first lamination/folding.

20. Roll the dough and shape as before into a 39 cm by 18 cm rectangle.
21.  Use a ruler to measure, and lightly mark the dough about one third of the way up from the bottom edge. Use your fingers to spread the remaining 100 grams of chilled butter onto the top two thirds of the pastry, and gently press it down.
22. Fold the lower one third up onto the grated butter in the centre.
23. Then fold the top one third over the top. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for 5 – 10 minutes.
Tip: When rolling the dough be careful not to squash and flatten the edges. Try and get the edges to be of a similar thickness as the rest of the dough.

 Refrigerate for 5 – 10 minutes.
4. Third Lamination – Folding Without Butter
Before rolling the dough, turn the dough so that the smooth surface is facing up and it’s in a lengthwise direction as pictured below. 

The third, fourth, and fifth folding is done without butter.

24. Roll the dough and shape as before into a 39 cm by 18 cm rectangle.
25. Lightly mark the dough about one third of the way up from the bottom edge.  
26. Fold the lower one third up onto the centre. Then fold the top one third over the top. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for 5 – 10 minutes.
Tip: Don’t worry too much if the dough doesn’t exactly match the measurements of 39 x 18 cm. It’s okay if there is a variation of 1-2 cm either way.
 Refrigerate for 5 – 10 minutes.
5. Fourth Lamination – Folding Without Butter 
Before rolling the dough, turn the dough so that the smooth surface is facing up and it’s in a lengthwise direction as pictured below. 


27.  Roll the dough and shape as before into a 39 cm by 18 cm rectangle.
28. Lightly mark the dough about one third of the way up from the bottom edge.  
29.  Fold the lower one third up onto the centre. Then fold the top one third over the top. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for 5 – 10 minutes.
 Refrigerate for 5 – 10 minutes.
6. Fifth Lamination – Folding Without Butter 
Before rolling the dough, turn the dough so that the smooth surface is facing up and it’s in a lengthwise direction as pictured below. 


30. Roll the dough and shape as before into a 39 cm by 18 cm rectangle.
31. Lightly mark the dough about one third of the way up from the bottom edge. 
32. Fold the lower one third up onto the centre. Then fold the top one third over the top. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight before using.
 Refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight before using.

How Much Does This Recipe Make?
This recipe makes about 780 grams of dough, and will make 2 sheets of pastry, 3-5 mm thick and about 33 – 35 cm square.
How To Store Rough Puff Pastry?

33. After refrigeration cut the dough into two even sized pieces and tightly wrap in plastic. It can be stored in the fridge for about 5 days.
Can Rough Puff Pastry Be Frozen?
Yes, homemade puff pastry can be frozen. Wrap the dough tightly in several layers of plastic and freeze for up to three months. To use, transfer the frozen dough from the freezer to the fridge and allow to thaw overnight before rolling.
How To Roll Rough Puff Pastry?

34. Take one half of the chilled rough puff pastry dough and roll out lengthwise, so that it increases slightly in length. 
Tip: The dough will be firm at first but will soften as you continue to roll. If you find the dough too firm to roll, leave it on the bench for 5 minutes before rolling.
35. Rotate the dough a quarter turn and use the rolling pin to roll dough out for form a square.
36. Continue to roll and rotate the dough, while keeping a square shape. Roll until about 33 – 35 cm square, which will make the dough about 3 – 5 mm thick and ready to be used.
Don’t be tempted to roll the dough larger than 33 – 35 cm size, it will make the dough too thin and it may not rise properly.
37. While rolling, occasionally lift the dough and dust underneath with flour.

What Can Rough Puff Pastry Be Used For?
Rough puff pastry can be used in any recipe that calls for the use of puff pastry. It can be used to make sausage rolls, pies, quiches, sweet puff pastry tarts, appetisers and a lot more.
Cooking Rough Puff Pastry
Always preheat the oven to 200°C before baking the pastry, if you don’t the pastry won’t cook properly, making it greasy and not flaky. Bake until the pastry is puffed and golden brown and use the recipe you are making as a guide for baking times.

EquipmentMetric scalesLarge mixing bowlMetric jugGrater or vegetable peelerRolling pinRulerPlastic food wrap
Ingredients260 grams cold butter salted or unsalted150 ml cold water + a little extra if needed½ teaspoon white vinegar350 grams plain flour (all purpose or weak flour)1 teaspoon salt
InstructionsAdvanced PreparationGrate or use a peeler to shave the butter then divide into three portions, make one 60 grams and the other two 100 grams each, then place back into the fridge to chill and leave there until needed.Note: Weigh the butter after grating.   Chill the water, you could use water straight from the fridge or chill tap water with a few ice blocks before measuring it. Once you have measured the water, mix in the white vinegar.Making The DoughIn a bowl, add the flour, salt and 60 grams of butter, use your fingertips to rub the butter into the flour, until it looks like coarse breadcrumbs.Add the vinegar and enough water to the dough so that it just comes together – it shouldn’t be too dry or wet.  Place the dough on a light floured bench and knead for about a minute. The dough should be firm and not sticky. Cover with plastic and let it rest in the fridge for 5 minutes.Note: The amount of water that is needed can vary, depending on the flour and temperature of the day. So, you could end up using a little less or a little more water. Use your hands to shape the dough into a rectangle, placing it onto a lightly  floured surface in a lengthwise direction facing you.Roll the dough out into a rectangle about 15- 18 cm wide and 38 – 40 cm long. As you roll the dough stop and measure, and use your hands to push the edges straight and gently pull on the corners to make them less rounded. Use your fingers and spread 100 grams of chilled butter on the top two thirds of the pastry. The butter does not have to completely cover the dough it can be patchy, lightly press the butter onto the dough. Fold the lower one third portion (without butter) up toward the middle, then fold the top third portion over the folded pastry.Tip: When rolling the dough, lift it occasionally from the bench and dust underneath with a little flour, this will stop it from sticking to the surface. Place the dough in the fridge for 5 – 10 minutes.Remove the chilled dough from the fridge, roll the dough in a lengthwise direction into a rectangle, about the same size as before, Spread the remaining 100 grams of chilled butter over the top two thirds of the pastry, then fold the lower third of the pastry to the middle, and fold the top third portion over the top. Place the dough in the fridge for 5 – 10 minutes.Remove the chilled dough from the fridge, roll the dough in a lengthwise direction into a rectangle, about the same size as before. Fold the lower third of the pastry to the middle, then fold the top third portion over the top. Place the dough in the fridge for 5 – 10 minutes.Repeat step 8 two more times, with 5 – 10 minutes chilling time in between. When you have finished, wrap the dough in plastic and place in the fridge for 4 hour or overnight before using.After chilling cut the dough into two even sized pieces and tightly wrap in plastic. It can be stored in the fridge for about 5 days, or it can be frozen for three months. Making The Puff Pastry SheetsTake one half of the chilled rough puff pastry dough and roll out lengthwise, so that it increases slightly in length. Rotate the dough a quarter turn and use the rolling pin to roll dough out for form a square.  Continue to roll and rotate the dough, while keeping a square shape. Roll until about 33 – 35 cm square, which will make the dough about 3 – 5 mm thick and ready to be used. Repeat the above for the remaining half of the dough or freeze it for another day.

28,https://bakerbettie.com/quick-puff-pastry/,"Put the flour in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook.With the mixer running on low speed, add the cold 1-inch pieces of butter a few pieces at a time. The dough hook will ""cut"" the butter into the flour. Once the butter is cut throughout the flour (it will look like very coarse meal), stop the mixer. You do not want to knead the dough.Combine the salt and the water together. Turn the mixer back on low speed and add the water/salt mixture to the mixing bowl. Mix only until the dough comes together enough to handle. You should still see lumps of butter and the dough will look like a pie dough.Form the dough into a square and let it rest in the refrigerator for 10 minutes. You can place it on a sheet pan or wrap in a piece of plastic wrap while it rests.Roll the dough out in the shape of a rectangle to about 1/2"" thick. Starting on the short end of the dough, fold 1/3 of the dough toward the center. Take the other 1/3 of the dough and fold it over the center, overlapping the already folded dough. This is called a ""single turn"" (see picture below). ""Single Turn""Repeat step 5 two more times.Roll the dough out in the shape of a rectangle to about 1/2"" thick. Starting on the short end of the dough, fold 1/4 of the dough toward the center. Take the other 1/4 of the dough and fold it toward the center so that the two ends are meeting in the middle. Fold the dough in half as if you are closing a book. This is called a ""double turn"" (see picture below). ""Double Turn""Your dough is now ready to be shaped. After it is shaped, allow it to rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before baking to prevent shrinkage.

With a tips and practice, master the flaky pastry.  Author: Nick Malgieri Recipe Type: Baking, Dough   Ingredients  2⅓ cups unbleached all-purpose flour 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened ⅔ cup cold water, plus about 1 tablespoon more if necessary 1 tablespoon fine sea salt  Butter Block:  ¼ cup unbleached all-purpose flour 2¼ sticks unsalted butter, cold     Instructions  For the dough, combine the flour and butter in a bowl and rub in the butter so that no visible pieces remain. Don’t mix so much that it starts to become pasty. Stir the water and salt together and sprinkle all over the flour. Use a rubber spatula to dig to the bottom of the bowl and bring up the un-moistened flour, turning the bowl as you go. Don’t exert pressure on the dough, just bring the spatula up from the bottom of the bowl. After 10 or 12 strokes, if there are any dry bits of flour remaining, sprinkle a few drops of water until they adhere to the main mass of dough. Scrape the dough from the bowl to a lightly floured surface and dust the top with flour. Use your hands, the straight side of a bench scraper, and a ruler to shape the dough into an 8-inch square. Wrap the dough in plastic and chill for 1 hour. Shortly before the hour is up, prepare the butter block: Scatter half the flour on the work surface and cut the butter into 5 or 6 pieces. Turn the pieces in the flour to coat them and use a rolling pin to gently pound each piece of butter to soften it. Once all the butter has been pounded, scatter on some of the remaining flour, dusting the work surface again if necessary; stack one piece of butter on another and use the rolling pin to hammer them together. Repeat, adding the remaining pieces of butter to the stack. Scatter on the last of the flour, then quickly knead the butter into a solid mass and use your hands, the straight side of a bench scraper, and a ruler to shape the butter into an 8-inch square. Set the butter aside for a moment, scrape the surface free of any sticky bits of butter, and flour it. Unwrap the dough and place it on the work surface; flour the dough and roll it evenly to an 8 x 16-inch rectangle, with a short edge near you. Brush away any excess flour on the dough’s surface and place the butter on the end closest to you. Fold the dough down to enclose the butter and pinch the edges of the dough together. (see images above) Flour under and on top of the dough and use the rolling pin to start pressing the package of dough and butter in a succession of gentle and even strokes, moving from the closest edge to the farthest edge. Gently roll the dough in one direction, starting at the end nearest to you and without going over the opposite edge. Repeat, rolling from the far end back toward yourself. Repeat the rolling once more and make the dough an 8 x 16-inch rectangle. Brush excess flour from the dough, then fold both narrow ends toward the middle, leaving about a ½-inch space between them. Fold the dough in half along that center line to make 4 layers. Position the folded package of dough so that the closed fold, resembling the spine of a book, is on your left. Repeat step 5, this time rolling across as well as lengthwise, until the dough is as close to 8 x 16 inches as possible. Repeat step 6. Wrap and chill the dough for an hour or so. If you wait longer, you will need to let the dough soften slightly at room temperature before completing the rolling and folding process. When ready to resume rolling, repeat step 7 twice more. You’ve now rolled and folded the dough 4 times, giving it 4 “turns.” Wrap and chill the dough for at least half a day. After this, it’s ready to be used in any recipe that calls for it.    3.2.2885

 So many people think they can’t make puff pastry. But I’m going to show you today with this full blown out step by step tutorial with this easy puff pastry tutorial.  Not only am I going to give you the recipe, but I am also going to share with you absolutely everything that I know about making homemade puff pastry dough. All the tricks that I learned through the last few years of making it, and since this is another recipe from my mother-in-law, everything that she taught me.

There are a few key points in making the best puff pastry. I promise you that with any puff pastry recipe, it’s not the recipe that will bring you the success, but the technique. Every puff pastry recipe will have flour, salt, butter, and water. It’s all about the technique. And with the technique, you also need to right tools.

Fox Run 4050 Marble Rolling Pin and Base, White
 
A marble rolling pin is the best! Since it’s much heavier you don’t have to work the dough as much, so then your butter isn’t melting as much and thereby getting more layers. (more about that in the tutorial) And with this one, keeping it in the fridge or freezer makes it really cold, helping you keep your dough as cold as possible!
 I’ve had many different rolling pins over the years, but I have never had one that works as well as a marble one! I’d always thought that a marble rolling pin was expensive, but they are aren’t at all! This is the exact one that I have.
The next one is a pastry mat.   Having one makes keeping the dough even much easier, which is essential. A pastry mat has the measurements on it so you can easily keep the dough eve.  Also, using mat also lets you use much less flour while working with the pastry dough. Check out how cheap they actually are here!

How to make sure that this easy puff pastry turns out the best

Everything must be cold. Ice cold. You cannot skip this. If your ingredients are too warm then you won’t get the layers that you need that really make the pastry puff up. Your water, yes ice cold. Your butter? Put it in the freezer 1/2 an hour before beginning. Your rolling pin? That goes in the fridge as well. This is the most important step of all. Everything must be very cold.
Handle the dough carefully. If you work the dough too much and too roughly you will melt the butter and make it too smooth and thus you will get fewer layers resulting in less puff. Just remember when you are working with the dough to be as gentle as possible. No squishing.
Remember to count. I included a handy cheat sheet so that you can have the most important steps right beside you as well as an easy way to track how many times you’ve folded! You don’t want to have not enough folds because then it won’t puff as much since the layers are not there, and neither do you want to have too many folds because then you risk having the layers run together because they are running into each other.

 
Recipe and step by step tutorial for this easy puff pastry recipe
8 c flour
1 tsp salt
2  lbs butter(2 bricks, 4 cups)
2 3/4 ice water
Place your butter in the freezer
Get a 4 cup liquid measuring cup and fill it with 2 cups ice, then add 2 cups water, let it sit so that some of the ice can melt into the water, making it as cold as possible. If you don’t have ice, measure out your water and place it in the freezer so that it can get colder, while you’re getting the rest of the ingredients together. 
 
In a very large bowl measure your flour, stir it very well to ‘unpack’ it. Grab a second measuring cup, and dump flour into the 1 cup measuring cup, level off with a knife. You want to do this way. I promise, to much flour won’t have it turn out the way it is supposed to. 
Take your butter out of the freezer and cut it up. You want bigger pieces, but not too big. I cut 9 slices, and then cut each slice into 9 pieces:

Dump all your butter into the flour. Stir to coat all the butter in flour. Then measure out 2 3/4 c water out of the ice and dump it into the flour/butter. Stir it until it sort of begins to clump together, about 12 ‘stirs’.  You need a really big bowl for this!  It is alot of flour and butter/water, so the best way to do this is with one of these large shallow bowls.

Once it clumps together, dump it out onto your counter and begin folding. Do not knead. For those of you who have seen my pie crust tutorial, its the same idea as that. If you haven’t, check out my tutorial on how to get tender and flaky pie crust. 
Shape it into a rectangle, then take the top and fold it over into the bottom, then push it down with the heel of your hand(you will actually be using both hands, but my other hand had my camera) Continue to turn and fold until it comes together. As you can see in the pictures you don’t want a smooth dough. You need to have a lot of butter chunks in it. Take a close look at the pictures to see approximately what your dough should be like.

Once it has started to come together, shape it into a rectangle. It should be in the shape of it mostly already. Then fold it into a ‘book’. Take the top end and fold it about a third of the way down. Grab the bottom and fold it up to the top fold, then fold them over together. 

Wrap well in plastic wrap and put it in the freezer for 20 minutes. Remember to put your rolling pin in there as well.
As mentioned in the beginning of this tutorial, I highly recommend using a marble rolling pin! The rolling pin is much heavier not only making it easier on yourself, but also, you won’t need to work the dough as much causing the dough to become warmer and melting the layers together. It also gets much colder in the freezer than any other rolling pin will!
How to roll and fold puff pastry correctly
Once 20 minutes is up, take it out of the freezer. At this point, I love using my pastry mat for accuracy in measuring and rolling it out. While you don’t have to have a mat, it does make it easier and you get a much more uniform look at the end. Place your dough on the mat and coat in a little flour. Turn it length-wise like the picture.
Having a  pastry mat makes the next steps so much easier! Keeping the dough even is pretty essential. Having a pastry mat allows you to do this so much easier with the measurements on it. Also, using mat also lets you use much less flour while working with the pastry dough. Check out how cheap they actually are here!
Place the rolling pin on top of the dough and push down. Pick the rolling pin up and move it over a little pushing it down again. You don’t want to do any rolling here yet. Just continue to pick it up and push it down until you’ve stretched it out and flattened it some so that it’s easier to work with. Now you can start rolling to flatten it a little more. Being careful, though, you don’t want to roll over the edges causing them to seal, so just stay way from the edges a little. 

You will not have a smooth looking dough yet! Keep this in mind. You won’t get a smooth dough until we are pretty much finished. See how there are still many big pieces of butter and how it’s still very chunky looking? That’s the way its supposed to be. If it’s smooth then you over-worked the dough and it won’t puff near as much. 
Fold it back into the book fold, wrap (I always use the same 2 pieces of saran wrap) and place back into the freezer for 30 minutes. This counts as the first fold. You are going to roll it out into the same size 4 more times. Make sure you download this cheet sheet so you can easily keep track of the number of folds, plus all the other tips included so you don’t forget!
 
Here’s a little tip: If it’s getting close to lunch time or really anything during the day that you are not going to be able to come back to it in half an hour, then just place it in the fridge. Just remember that it if it’s in the fridge it should be in there are least 45 minutes. Also, remember to put your rolling pin in there. 
I often start my dough by mid-morning and then have my second fold done right before we eat lunch, it goes in the fridge and then when we are done eating and I have the lunch dishes done an hour later, it is ready for the third fold. 
Each time you roll it out, remember to keep the pressure as even as possible. If you need to, make it a little longer than the 15 inches if the one end is getting fatter than the other. You are much better off with it being longer than having one side wider than the other. The more even you can keep it the better.
Keep in mind, though, unless you’re a pro(and you probably aren’t if you’re reading this tutorial) you will have a little of unevenness. I have been making puff pastry for 5 years now, and it’s still not always perfectly even. As long as you try to keep it even by rolling it out longer than wider, then you should still be fine. 
It will take almost all 5 of the folds to get a smooth pastry dough.

Now that you have done 5 folds, put it back in the freezer for 45 minutes(or fridge, just remember that it will need about double the time, if I know I won’t get to it, then it goes in the fridge, it won’t matter if it’s in there for 2 hours.
Once this resting and cooling time is over roll it out again but in 12 inches of length. It’s easier with this number because you will be able to cut it evenly and honestly? By the time you have gotten this far, it will be pretty hard to roll out. I need put my entire weight on my rolling pin to get it to flatten. By this time I like doing it on my dining room table so that it’s easier to use my weight. I’m only 5′ 2′ so it can be a little difficult to do this if it’s on the counter. 
Once you have it rolled to 12 inches, cut it into 4 sections(in the width). Then cut each piece into 3, giving you 12 pieces.

Wrap each individual piece. It best to let them sit in the fridge overnight. You want them to get completely cold. As cold as possible. To be really honest, I almost always place one of the pieces in the freezer for 2-3 hours and then roll out one section so that we can have pastry for dessert. I’m not going to go through all that work and not taste it the same day!
Once each piece is cooled overnight or in the freezer for at least 2-3 hours. 
You really do get better results if it has been in the fridge overnight.
Once each piece is cooled overnight or in the freezer for at least 2-3 hours. You really do get better results if it has been in the fridge overnight. Roll it into a sheet of 15×20 inches. Once you have the sheet you can either freeze the sheets with wax paper in-between or make a pastry dessert.
If you place them in the freezer just take out, however many sheets you need and let them thaw on the counter. It usually doesn’t take them more than 15-20 minutes to thaw until workable. Check out my super Easy apple turnover recipe here. This is my husband’s favorite dessert!

Pheew! And there you have it. Your very comprehensive puff pastry tutorial so that you can wow your guests! And I promise, while it takes time, because there is so much resting time, once you learn how to do it properly it really is easy to make puff pastry!

Ingredients

8 c flour
1 tsp salt
2 lbs butter, cubed
2 3/4 c ice water



Instructions
Measure your flour into a large mixing bowl by scooping into the measuring cup and leveling off. Add salt. Cube butter into chunks.Stir in ice water. Stir with spoon for about 12 'stirs'. then dump onto the counter and using the folding method, 'knead' it together,(takes about 12 folds) being careful not to over-work the dough.
Make sure that the butter stays chunky and that it doesn't become a smooth dough. Handle very gently. Once it has started to come together, shape into a rectangle and fold into a book but folding it into thirds. Wrap and freeze for 30 minutes
Once its been in the freezer for 30 minutes, take it out and on a pastry mat, push the dough down with a heavy rolling pin. Push and roll out till it comes to a size of 15 inches long and 22 cm wide. Fold into the book again and freeze another 30 minutes. Repeat 4 more times. Once you have done 5 folds, roll it out to 12 inches in length. Cut it into 4 equal length pieces, and each of those pieces into 3,giving you 12 pieces. You should see layers in the dough on the cut side. This is where your puffiness will come from. Its best to wrap them all individually and let rest overnight. Otherwise, let them rest in the freezer for at least 2 hours. Roll out into a 10x12 sheet. Make into your favorite puff pastry recipe or freeze by placing wax paper between each sheet. May be frozen for 6 months(starts to get freezer burnt after that)







 So many people think they can’t make puff pastry. But I’m going to show you today with this full blown out step by step tutorial with this easy puff pastry tutorial.  Not only am I going to give you the recipe, but I am also going to share with you absolutely everything that I know about making homemade puff pastry dough. All the tricks that I learned through the last few years of making it, and since this is another recipe from my mother-in-law, everything that she taught me.

There are a few key points in making the best puff pastry. I promise you that with any puff pastry recipe, it’s not the recipe that will bring you the success, but the technique. Every puff pastry recipe will have flour, salt, butter, and water. It’s all about the technique. And with the technique, you also need to right tools.

Fox Run 4050 Marble Rolling Pin and Base, White
 
A marble rolling pin is the best! Since it’s much heavier you don’t have to work the dough as much, so then your butter isn’t melting as much and thereby getting more layers. (more about that in the tutorial) And with this one, keeping it in the fridge or freezer makes it really cold, helping you keep your dough as cold as possible!
 I’ve had many different rolling pins over the years, but I have never had one that works as well as a marble one! I’d always thought that a marble rolling pin was expensive, but they are aren’t at all! This is the exact one that I have.
The next one is a pastry mat.   Having one makes keeping the dough even much easier, which is essential. A pastry mat has the measurements on it so you can easily keep the dough eve.  Also, using mat also lets you use much less flour while working with the pastry dough. Check out how cheap they actually are here!

How to make sure that this easy puff pastry turns out the best

Everything must be cold. Ice cold. You cannot skip this. If your ingredients are too warm then you won’t get the layers that you need that really make the pastry puff up. Your water, yes ice cold. Your butter? Put it in the freezer 1/2 an hour before beginning. Your rolling pin? That goes in the fridge as well. This is the most important step of all. Everything must be very cold.
Handle the dough carefully. If you work the dough too much and too roughly you will melt the butter and make it too smooth and thus you will get fewer layers resulting in less puff. Just remember when you are working with the dough to be as gentle as possible. No squishing.
Remember to count. I included a handy cheat sheet so that you can have the most important steps right beside you as well as an easy way to track how many times you’ve folded! You don’t want to have not enough folds because then it won’t puff as much since the layers are not there, and neither do you want to have too many folds because then you risk having the layers run together because they are running into each other.

 
Recipe and step by step tutorial for this easy puff pastry recipe
8 c flour
1 tsp salt
2  lbs butter(2 bricks, 4 cups)
2 3/4 ice water
Place your butter in the freezer
Get a 4 cup liquid measuring cup and fill it with 2 cups ice, then add 2 cups water, let it sit so that some of the ice can melt into the water, making it as cold as possible. If you don’t have ice, measure out your water and place it in the freezer so that it can get colder, while you’re getting the rest of the ingredients together. 
 
In a very large bowl measure your flour, stir it very well to ‘unpack’ it. Grab a second measuring cup, and dump flour into the 1 cup measuring cup, level off with a knife. You want to do this way. I promise, to much flour won’t have it turn out the way it is supposed to. 
Take your butter out of the freezer and cut it up. You want bigger pieces, but not too big. I cut 9 slices, and then cut each slice into 9 pieces:

Dump all your butter into the flour. Stir to coat all the butter in flour. Then measure out 2 3/4 c water out of the ice and dump it into the flour/butter. Stir it until it sort of begins to clump together, about 12 ‘stirs’.  You need a really big bowl for this!  It is alot of flour and butter/water, so the best way to do this is with one of these large shallow bowls.

Once it clumps together, dump it out onto your counter and begin folding. Do not knead. For those of you who have seen my pie crust tutorial, its the same idea as that. If you haven’t, check out my tutorial on how to get tender and flaky pie crust. 
Shape it into a rectangle, then take the top and fold it over into the bottom, then push it down with the heel of your hand(you will actually be using both hands, but my other hand had my camera) Continue to turn and fold until it comes together. As you can see in the pictures you don’t want a smooth dough. You need to have a lot of butter chunks in it. Take a close look at the pictures to see approximately what your dough should be like.

Once it has started to come together, shape it into a rectangle. It should be in the shape of it mostly already. Then fold it into a ‘book’. Take the top end and fold it about a third of the way down. Grab the bottom and fold it up to the top fold, then fold them over together. 

Wrap well in plastic wrap and put it in the freezer for 20 minutes. Remember to put your rolling pin in there as well.
As mentioned in the beginning of this tutorial, I highly recommend using a marble rolling pin! The rolling pin is much heavier not only making it easier on yourself, but also, you won’t need to work the dough as much causing the dough to become warmer and melting the layers together. It also gets much colder in the freezer than any other rolling pin will!
How to roll and fold puff pastry correctly
Once 20 minutes is up, take it out of the freezer. At this point, I love using my pastry mat for accuracy in measuring and rolling it out. While you don’t have to have a mat, it does make it easier and you get a much more uniform look at the end. Place your dough on the mat and coat in a little flour. Turn it length-wise like the picture.
Having a  pastry mat makes the next steps so much easier! Keeping the dough even is pretty essential. Having a pastry mat allows you to do this so much easier with the measurements on it. Also, using mat also lets you use much less flour while working with the pastry dough. Check out how cheap they actually are here!
Place the rolling pin on top of the dough and push down. Pick the rolling pin up and move it over a little pushing it down again. You don’t want to do any rolling here yet. Just continue to pick it up and push it down until you’ve stretched it out and flattened it some so that it’s easier to work with. Now you can start rolling to flatten it a little more. Being careful, though, you don’t want to roll over the edges causing them to seal, so just stay way from the edges a little. 

You will not have a smooth looking dough yet! Keep this in mind. You won’t get a smooth dough until we are pretty much finished. See how there are still many big pieces of butter and how it’s still very chunky looking? That’s the way its supposed to be. If it’s smooth then you over-worked the dough and it won’t puff near as much. 
Fold it back into the book fold, wrap (I always use the same 2 pieces of saran wrap) and place back into the freezer for 30 minutes. This counts as the first fold. You are going to roll it out into the same size 4 more times. Make sure you download this cheet sheet so you can easily keep track of the number of folds, plus all the other tips included so you don’t forget!
 
Here’s a little tip: If it’s getting close to lunch time or really anything during the day that you are not going to be able to come back to it in half an hour, then just place it in the fridge. Just remember that it if it’s in the fridge it should be in there are least 45 minutes. Also, remember to put your rolling pin in there. 
I often start my dough by mid-morning and then have my second fold done right before we eat lunch, it goes in the fridge and then when we are done eating and I have the lunch dishes done an hour later, it is ready for the third fold. 
Each time you roll it out, remember to keep the pressure as even as possible. If you need to, make it a little longer than the 15 inches if the one end is getting fatter than the other. You are much better off with it being longer than having one side wider than the other. The more even you can keep it the better.
Keep in mind, though, unless you’re a pro(and you probably aren’t if you’re reading this tutorial) you will have a little of unevenness. I have been making puff pastry for 5 years now, and it’s still not always perfectly even. As long as you try to keep it even by rolling it out longer than wider, then you should still be fine. 
It will take almost all 5 of the folds to get a smooth pastry dough.

Now that you have done 5 folds, put it back in the freezer for 45 minutes(or fridge, just remember that it will need about double the time, if I know I won’t get to it, then it goes in the fridge, it won’t matter if it’s in there for 2 hours.
Once this resting and cooling time is over roll it out again but in 12 inches of length. It’s easier with this number because you will be able to cut it evenly and honestly? By the time you have gotten this far, it will be pretty hard to roll out. I need put my entire weight on my rolling pin to get it to flatten. By this time I like doing it on my dining room table so that it’s easier to use my weight. I’m only 5′ 2′ so it can be a little difficult to do this if it’s on the counter. 
Once you have it rolled to 12 inches, cut it into 4 sections(in the width). Then cut each piece into 3, giving you 12 pieces.

Wrap each individual piece. It best to let them sit in the fridge overnight. You want them to get completely cold. As cold as possible. To be really honest, I almost always place one of the pieces in the freezer for 2-3 hours and then roll out one section so that we can have pastry for dessert. I’m not going to go through all that work and not taste it the same day!
Once each piece is cooled overnight or in the freezer for at least 2-3 hours. 
You really do get better results if it has been in the fridge overnight.
Once each piece is cooled overnight or in the freezer for at least 2-3 hours. You really do get better results if it has been in the fridge overnight. Roll it into a sheet of 15×20 inches. Once you have the sheet you can either freeze the sheets with wax paper in-between or make a pastry dessert.
If you place them in the freezer just take out, however many sheets you need and let them thaw on the counter. It usually doesn’t take them more than 15-20 minutes to thaw until workable. Check out my super Easy apple turnover recipe here. This is my husband’s favorite dessert!

34,https://www.finecooking.com/recipe/rough-puff-pastry,"Sift the flour and salt onto the cold cubes of butter. Using a pastry scraper or a large chef&#8217;s knife, cut the butter into the flour. Work until you have a crumbly mixture. Flatten any large chunks of butter with just your fingertips. Add the ice-cold water a little at a time to loosely bind the dough. Mix the dough with the pastry scraper until it just hangs together. Shape the messy, shaggy dough into a rough rectangle and roll it out until it&#8217;s 1/2 inch thick. Resist the temptation to overwater or overwork the dough; it will eventually hold together.Use the pastry scraper to fold the dough in thirds like a business letter. Don&#8217;t worry if it folds in pieces. Turn the package of dough 90 degrees so the folds run vertically. Square off the edges of the dough as you work. Roll the dough into a rectangle that&#8217;s 1/2 inch thick, always rolling from open end to open end. Continue rolling, folding, and turning until the dough looks smooth. By four or five &#8220;turns,&#8221; the dough should hang together well.For even more layers, fold the smooth dough up like a book. To do this, fold the two shorter sides into the center and then fold the dough like a book. Brush off excess flour as you fold. Wrap the dough and chill it for half an hour before giving it two final turns. At this point, you can then use the dough, though another short rest will make rolling and shaping easier.",puff_pastry

Before starting this Puff Pastry recipe, make sure you have organised all the necessary ingredients.In the stand mixer bowl, place the flour. If you don't have a stand mixer and want to make puff pastry from scratch, arrange the flour in the shape of a fountain on your workbench.Add the salt...... and water (at room temperature).Place the recipient in the stand mixer...... then fit with the dough hook...... and work at medium speed for a few minutes. Once all the flour is incorporated...... transfer the dough onto your kitchen worktop...... and give it the shape of a ball. The dough ball should be quite compact. If you are not using a mixer, gather the flour with your fingers by drawing it into the water, until all the flour is incorporated.You will end up with a compact ball.Using a knife, score the top of the ball with a cross. The détrempe is now ready.Wrap the dough ball in cling film...... and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Rolling and folding process:  Flour your kitchen worktop...... and place the détrempe in front of you.With your fingers, squash the four corners of the ball.Roll out the ball, maintaining the 'cross' shape.The centre should be thicker.In the centre, place the butter (at room temperature). Shape the butter into a rectangle that fits in the centre of the dough.Fold the top corner of the dough over the butter.Fold the opposite side (bottom corner) over.Fold the right corner over...... making sure the edges are sealed and regular.Brush off the flour excess every time...... then fold the left corner over.Now that the butter is completely enclosed, bash the square with a rolling pin, in order to incorporate the butter into the dough. Make sure the square shape is maintained.Roll out the square lengthwise...... making sure the butter is not coming out of the dough. Shape the dough into a long rectangle, to a thickness of about 1cm.Give the dough a quarter-turn...... anti-clockwise. Flatten the corners a bit if necessary.Fold the dough into three parts. Start by folding the right third over...... then the left third.Make sure the edges are sealed and regular.Roll out the pastry again, lengthwise.Give the dough a quarter-turn (anticlockwise) and fold into thirds again.Start by folding the right third over...... then the left one. Make sure the edges are sealed and regular.Make a mark in the dough by sticking 2 fingers in. This means the dough has been folded 2 times. This easy tip is the best I found to always remember how many times the dough was folded, in the event you want to continue the folding process later or if someone else does.This technique is most likely to be used in commercial kitchens where several batches of puff pastry are being made at the same time, but I encourage everyone to use it. Wrap the dough in cling film and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. The first two folds are now done. Puff pastry needs to be folded 6 times.Place the ball on a floured surface.Roll out the pastry, lengthwise. Give the dough a quarter-turn (anticlockwise).
Important: Clockwise or anticlockwise, always follow the same direction.Fold the dough into three parts. Start by folding the right third over...... making sure to brush off the flour excess.Then fold the left third over. Make sure the edges are sealed and regular.Roll out the pastry again, lengthwise.Give the dough a quarter-turn (anticlockwise)...... and fold the dough into three parts. Start by folding the right third over...... then the left one. Make sure the edges are sealed and regular.Make a mark in the dough by sticking 4 fingers in. This means the dough has been folded 4 times.This way, you will remember exactly how many folds have been made. As mentioned earlier, I highly recommend using this easy tip.Wrap the dough in cling film and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. The first four folds are now done. Puff pastry needs to be folded 6 times.Place the dough on a floured surface.Roll out the pastry, lengthwise.Give the dough a quarter-turn (anticlockwise).Fold the dough into three parts.

This means the dough has been folded 6 times and that the folding process is over.The pastry is now ready to use. Beforehand though, wrap the dough in cling film and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Puff pastry can be stored for up to 3 or 4 days in the fridge, and for several weeks in the freezer. Wrap it in cling film for optimal storage conditions.

Puff Pastry can be stored in the freezer in the original packaging for up to 6 months.
Remove only as many pastry sheets as you need. Wrap unused sheets in plastic wrap or foil and return to the freezer.
Puff Pastry can puff up to 8 times its original thickness. That means even a sheet rolled to a thin ¼-inch thickness will rise 2 inches
Helpful Puff Pastry tools: Rolling pin, pastry board, sharp knife and/or pizza wheel to cut dough, pastry brush, baking sheets or parchment paper.
If you don’t have a pastry brush, you can use the tip of a rolled-up paper towel or your fingertip to apply egg wash.
Puff Pastry should be eaten within a few hours of baking. Keep filled and prepared pastry in the fridge, covered in plastic wrap, until you’re ready to bake and serve.



Thawing & Prepping Puff Pastry

Facebook
Twitter


Don’t try to manipulate Puff Pastry that’s not completely thawed; unfolding it while it’s still frozen could tear the sheet.
Thaw time may vary. Pastry should unfold easily but still be cold after thawing. If sheets reach room temperature, return to the fridge to rechill (but not refreeze).
To thaw at room temperature, remove pastry sheet(s) from the box and outer wrapping. Thaw pastry sheet(s) until the pastry unfolds easily, no more than 40 minutes.
To thaw in the microwave, remove 1 pastry sheet from the box and outer wrapping and wrap in a paper towel. Microwave on HIGH for 15 seconds. Turn the pastry sheet over. Microwave another 15 seconds. If pastry doesn’t unfold easily, microwave for another 5 seconds on each side.
You can thaw Puff Pastry in the fridge. Separate and place each sheet on a plate, cover with plastic wrap and defrost in the refrigerator for about 4 hours.
Once Puff Pastry is thawed, work quickly while it’s still cold. You can cut it into desired shapes, then store in the fridge until you’re ready for the next step.
Puff Pastry works best when cold. So chill your tools—knife, pastry/pizza cutter, cookie cutters, even pastry board and baking pans in the fridge—while thawing your pastry.
Use a long, heavy rolling pin to roll out your Puff Pastry dough: it helps create a pastry that’s even all over and you won’t have to press down too hard to roll it out.
Avoid pressing too hard when rolling out the ends and edges—you want to avoid pressing the edge layers together, as that will prevent the pastry from rising.



Handling Puff Pastry

Facebook
Twitter


Work with one Puff Pastry sheet at a time, keeping the others in the refrigerator.
Heat is the enemy of Puff Pastry—it handles best when cold. So avoid working with it on hot, humid days, in a stifling hot kitchen or next to your oven.
Puff Pastry works best when cold. Your hands should be cold, too, when handling it. Run them under cold water or squeeze a plastic zipper-top bag full of ice to cool them off.
Try to keep Puff Pastry from becoming too warm when working with it by only using your fingertips—the coolest part of your hands.
If any cracks form while you’re working with Puff Pastry, just rub with a little water and press to seal the dough together.
Use a marble pastry board to help keep Puff Pastry cold while rolling and cutting.
Use a floured surface to roll out your Puff Pastry sheet, but be sure to brush off excess flour before filling, cutting or folding, since flour will prevent layers from sticking together.
When cutting Puff Pastry, the sharper the knife or pastry cutter, the better. A dull edge can cement layers together and prevent pastry from rising.
Always cut Puff Pastry straight down, never on an angle, to prevent layers from sticking together and inhibiting the rise. Cut up and down, and don’t drag the knife.
You can brush an egg-wash glaze (1 egg plus 1 tsp. water) over the Puff Pastry to create a rich, golden sheen when baked.
Use an egg wash to help seal filled pastries and connect Puff Pastry pieces: mix 1 egg plus 1 tsp. water, brush between layers, then pinch or press together.
When using an egg wash, be sure it doesn’t run down the cut sides of the pastry, as that will make edges stick together and stop the pastry from rising.
If your Puff Pastry becomes soft and sticky while working with it, chill it in the fridge for a few minutes. Place in the refrigerator between rollings, too.
To seal stuffed Puff Pastries, pinch the edges together or press with the tines of a fork, just as you’d seal a piecrust.
Make sure the edges of your Puff Pastry are cut—a folded edge will not rise and puff.



Baking Puff Pastry

Facebook
Twitter


Always preheat your oven for a minimum of 15-20 minutes before baking, because Puff Pastry depends on even heat to rise and puff. Place pastries 1 inch apart.
If you want a flaky thin and crispy pastry that’s not very puffy, prick the unbaked Puff Pastry all over with a fork, which lets steam escape while baking.
For a flatter pastry without much puff—like a Napoleon—prick the dough all over with a fork, place parchment paper on top, then place 1-2 cookie sheets on top of that to weigh it down.
If you’re making a tart or filled Puff Pastry, place it on the baking sheet before adding toppings or fillings. That way, you won’t have to transfer the dough with the extra weight and risk tearing it.
For extra-thin, crisp Puff Pastry, set a second baking sheet on top of the filled pastry before baking.
To create a tart with an extra puffy crust: take a knife and score two lines around the edge, then prick the area inside this border with a fork.
Puff Pastry fillings should be at room temperature. If they’re hot, they can begin to melt the pastry layers, which will affect the pastry’s ability to rise and puff.
The kind of pan you use can affect baking times. A nonstick or dark glazed baking sheet may bake faster, so adjust your time and check pastry while baking.
When baking Puff Pastry, note that it’s done when it’s golden and puffy, not wet and doughy. Use the baking time in the recipe as a guideline, and rely on your eyes as well.
You can bake Puff Pastry on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. For a more even rise, place a sheet of parchment paper on top of your pastry as well.
How to tell if Puff Pastry is done baking? Take a sharp knife and nick off a teensy piece to test for crispness and flakiness.
Always use a preheated conventional oven to bake Puff Pastry, never a microwave or toaster oven, as they can’t achieve the right golden puffy effect.
If bubbles appear on the surface while baking Puff Pastry, prick with a fork to deflate them.
Always flip and place the cut side of the Puff Pastry down on the baking sheet.



Serving & Decorating Puff Pastry

Facebook
Twitter


A lattice pattern can be created by topping the Puff Pastry with a metal cooling rack, then turning it at a right angle halfway through the baking.
You can use a fluted ravioli cutter or cookie cutters to create decorative edges or shapes. To create circles, use a plate, bowl or water glass and trace with a knife.
You can use scraps to make cookies by sprinkling sugar and cinnamon on top before baking; or make cheese straws by doing the same with grated Parmesan and chopped fresh herbs.
Puff Pastry scraps can be twisted into shapes and cut with cookie cutters to make pastry decorations, but don’t re-roll together with your dough, as it will not rise properly.
To add special texture and flavor, sprinkle chopped nuts, seeds, ground spices or grated cheese on top.
When serving Puff Pastry, cut with a serrated knife for the most even, attractive presentation.



Tips for Puff Pastry Shells & Cups

Facebook
Twitter


Remove as many Puff Pastry Shells or Cups from the package as needed. Rewrap any unused pastry Shells or Cups in plastic wrap or foil and return to the freezer.
Place Puff Pastry Shells or Cups on ungreased baking sheets with “top” facing up. Place Shells or Cups about 2 inches apart on baking sheet.
Always bake Puff Pastry Shells in a preheated 425° F oven. Do not bake Shells in a microwave or a toaster oven.
The top works well as a garnish.
Unfilled baked Puff Pastry Shells or Cups may be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days.
To recrisp Puff Pastry shells, place them in a 400° F oven for 5 minutes.
Always bake Puff Pastry Cups in a preheated 400° F oven. Do not bake Cups in a microwave or a toaster oven.

Continue adding and tossing until mixture is wet enough to stick together, but not overly wet.  You may not need the entire egg/milk mixture.Dump dough out onto lightly floured surface and press with your hands into somewhat of a cohesive mass.  Using a rolling pin, press down at different places in the mass into a rectangle about 7 by 10 or 11 inches long.  It will be messy and may look like it&#x27;s not going to come together at all.  Use a bench scraper or ruler to &quot;shore up&quot; the sides into a rectangle as best you can.Using the bench scraper or your hands, do your best to fold the top third of the dough down to the middle, just like you&#x27;d fold a letter, and then the bottom third up over the top third.  Large chunks may fall off.  Just put them back on and continue.  Turn the dough clockwise.  This is your first turn.Press and roll dough out again into 7 by 10-inch rectangle, adding a little flour as necessary to keep dough from sticking.&nbsp; Fold again into a letter style.&nbsp; Each time you do this, it will start to look more and more like a dough.&nbsp; Turn clockwise.&nbsp; This is your second turn.&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeat all of this again 4 more times for a total of 6 times.  If the dough begins to get too soft, stop rolling and folding and put in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes, noting which turn you were on.When completed, your dough should be totally cohesive and look similar to pie dough.  Wrap in plastic wrap and allow to chill for at least 1-2 hours before using as desired in any recipes calling for puff pastry or crescent rolls.For puff pastry or crescent dough recipes, increase the temperature by 50 degrees F for the first 5 minutes of baking and then drop it back to what your recipe normally calls for.  This will give the gluten free puff pastry a chance to puff well before baking the rest of the way.",puff_pastry

Puff Pastry


What is a Puff Pastry?
Puff pastry, also known as Pâte Feuilletée or feuilletage in French, is a very delicate and rich pastry that consists of many thin alternating layers of dough and fat. This lamination  is what gives puff pastry its light, crispy and flaky texture upon baking.
Puff pastry has a wide variety of uses that include but is not limited to:

Pies
Tarts
Allumettes
Bouchees
Vol-au-vents
Mille-fuille

Origin
The origin of the puff pastry is quite unclear. While the Dictionnaire universel de cuisine credits a chef named Feuillet with its invention; other sources indicate that puff pastry was known to  the ancient Greeks as shown in a charter drawn up by Robert, bishop of Amiens (1311). Despite this finding, puff pastry is known to have been brought back into fashion later by the artist, Claude Lorrain and a chef Feuillet, thus the name Pâte Feuilletée.2
How is puff pastry made?
While not included under the category of viennoiserie, puff pastry is traditionally processed in a similar manner with some modifications to improve or shorten the process.
Making puff pastry involves preparing a water-based dough, referred to as the detrempe which is flattened to enclose a block of butter (beurrage) within it. The dough/butter assembly is repeatedly sheeted out and folded to form alternating layers of dough and fat. Single, double folds or their combinations can be formed with a minimum of at least four single folds and up to a maximum of six.
Four basic variations of  puff pastry are commonly known:3,4

Blitz puff pastry: “Blitz” is a German word for “lightning,” a reference to the speed of the lamination process. Using this method, the fat is distributed throughout the dough non-uniformly in the form of small discs. Upon baking, Blitz pastry dough does not rise sufficiently which limits its utilization to cream fillings and other less refined applications.
Traditional puff pastry: the butter block is sandwiched between two layers of dough and then laminated. This process requires a fairly long processing time.
Italian puff pastry: also known as pasta sfogliata. This pastry dough contains white wine and eggs and requires intensive mixing prior to lamination using the traditional method.
Inverted puff pastry: as the name suggests, the layers of dough and fat are reversed in this pastry dough. A reversible dough sheeter is required for this process. Baking results in a crispy and flaky product as the layers of fat become one during lamination. Although this process is fairly difficult, the pastry dough does not shrink, therefore, eliminates the need for final rest as in other methods.

A typical puff pastry formula:4,5




Ingredient
Baker’s %


Dough 


Pastry flour / bread flour (or blends)
100.0


Butter
30.0–35.0


Water
45.0–50.0


Salt
2.0–2.5


Roll-in


Butter or pliable shortening (16°C)
50.0–60.0*


All-purpose flour (optional)
10.0




*Butter for lamination is a percent of the total dough weight.
Producing a high-quality puff pastry requires the following steps:

Ingredient scaling/metering
Mixing for 4-5 minutes until all ingredients are well incorporated. Full development of gluten occurs during the lamination process.
Resting of the dough for about 1 hour.
Sheeting the dough to the desired thickness.
Laminating into 5-6 single folds, two folds at a time followed by a 30 minutes of rest between each folding set.
Once the desired number of layers has been achieved, the dough is then sheeted down to around 0.6-0.8 inches to be baked or packaged.

Puff pastry can be prepared fresh or obtained as a ready-made chilled or frozen mass. Commercially, large-scale pastry dough manufacture can be made in batches or using continuous production lines. The pastry sheet containing the fat is rolled out and by transversal unfolding is reloaded from one belt to another of lower speed. A sheet of up to 128 layers of fat and dough can be obtained which is then cut, filled, shaped and brushed prior to packaging.
Application
Puff pastry’s final quality is dependent on how well the lamination process is carried out. The formation of crisp and flaky texture is caused by the vapor generated from the dough during baking and further entrapment by the fat layers. This vapor exerts sufficient pressure against the layers leading to their expansion. The higher the number of layers, the crispier the corresponding product. The generation of high quality puff pastry requires a variety of factors to be taken into consideration:

Sheetability: The process should avoid overstressing the dough. In some cases, proteases and/or reducing agents may be added to the dough during mixing to improve its sheetability.4
Lamination thickness: The layers must be sheeted to an even thickness to ensure even rise during baking.
Production temperature: A low  temperature (10–20°C) must be maintained in the plant to prevent the roll-in fat from melting or from becoming too hard to sheet well.
Melting point: The butter or fat must always have an adequate melting point and plasticity to ensure smooth running of the line. Traditionally, flour is mixed with the roll-in butter and set in a refrigerator prior to lamination to increase the dough’s plasticity and to keep it from melting.
Baking: Producing a crisp and flaky final product requires baking in a convection oven at 176°C for various durations depending on the product.

42,https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Puff-Pastry,"Pour the flour and salt into a food processor and pulse for a few seconds. This combines the flour and salt evenly. If you do not have a food processor, then pour the flour and salt into a bowl and mix with a fork.
If you are unable to purchase all-purpose flour, then use plain flour.Cut the butter into cubes. This will help the butter soften faster and make it easier to blend into the flour and salt.Add the butter a little bit at a time to the food processor and mix. Pulse the food processor for a few seconds before you add more butter. This makes the butter more manageable and prevent the blades from getting stuck.
If you do not have a food processor, put the butter into the bowl and mix it lightly with the flour using a fork. Then, roll a pastry blade across the butter and flour using a back and forth motion. Keep lifting and rocking the pastry blade until you have a rough, crumbly texture. The butter chunks should be roughly the size of a pea.Add the cold water and pulse for a few more seconds. The dough will start to come together and pull away from the sides of the bowl.
If you are using a bowl, lightly pat the dough down with your hands, then make a small well in the center. Pour the water into the well and mix with a fork until the dough starts to come away from the sides of the bowl.Cover the dough with plastic wrap and put it into the refrigerator for 20 minutes. This gives the butter time to cool back down, and prevents your dough from becoming too soft. After 20 minutes are up, take the dough out and unwrap it.Lightly flour your cutting board and rolling pin. This prevents the dough from sticking to everything. Be sure to keep a bag of flour on hand, in case you have to add more flour to your work surface; the dough will absorb the flour as you work with it, making the work surface sticky.Turn the dough onto the cutting board. The dough may feel dry, but this is normal. Do not add water to it; it will become softer the more you work with it.Form the dough into a flat square by kneading it gently. Do not make the dough too thin; you will be rolling it out some more later. You may see some streaks of butter in the dough, which is also normal. Do not attempt to mix the butter in.Use the rolling pin to roll the dough out into a rectangle. Roll in one direction only. The dough should be three times longer than it is wide.Fold the dough into thirds. Take the bottom third of the rectangle, and fold it just past the middle. Take the upper third of the rectangle and fold it down on top of the rest of the dough, making a square.Rotate the dough 90 degrees to either side. It does not matter which side: left or right. If the dough does not turn easily, it means that it has begun to stick to the cutting board. Gently lift it up and spread some more flour down onto the board. Set the dough back down and try rotating it again.Repeat the rolling, folding, and turning process six to seven more times. In this way, you are creating thin layers in the dough.Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and put it in the refrigerator. Leave it in there for at least one hour, or overnight.Use the dough. Once the dough has thoroughly chilled, you can take it out of the refrigerator, roll it out, and use it to make croissants, filled pastry bites, or even baked brie cheese.",puff_pastry
43,https://gluesticksblog.com/puff-pastry-recipe/,"Measure out 6 tablespoons of butter and place back in the refrigerator.Place the remaining chilled butter on a work surface, in between two pieces of waxed paper. Using a rolling pin or the heal of your hand, smash the butter into the surface until pliable, taking care not to over work the butter as it should stay chilled. Work butter into a 5-inch square. Wrap and place in refrigerator.Sift together flour and salt into a large mixing bowl. Dice the 6 tablespoons of chilled butter.Remember the 6 tablespoons of butter that you set aside? Go ahead and get that out and dice it into small cubes. Place the diced butter into the mixing bowl and, using a pastry blender, blend until the mixture is a coarse meal.Make a well in the center of the mixture and add the water. Use a rubber spatula to gradually blend the water with the flour mixture, mixing just until a rough, sticky dough is formed. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.Remove the rested dough from the refrigerator and place on a lightly floured work surface. Roll out dough into a 12-inch circle, being careful not to pull or tear the dough. Unwrap the butter square and place into the center of the circle and fold the edges of the dough over the butter, pressing to seal the edges.You should now have a square of butter wrapped in dough.Now we will begin the rolling process. The dough will be rolled out a total of 6 times.Using a rolling pin, roll the square into a 16 by 8-inch rectangle. (The dough may need to be pounded with the rolling pin several times to allow the butter to become more pliable.) Be careful not to tear the dough. Sprinkle any sticky areas with a tiny amount of flour.Fold the rectangle into thirds, as you would a business letter.Rotate the dough a quarter turn and roll into ANOTHER 16 by 8-inch rectangle.Fold again as you would a business letter.Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Note: you can write a &quot;2&quot; on the plastic wrap with a permanent marker to help you remember that you already rolled the dough out two times.Return the rested dough to a lightly floured surface and repeat the process of rolling the dough into a rectangle, making business-letter folds, giving it a quarter turn and rolling and folding once more.Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least another 30 minutes. Note: you can write a &quot;4&quot; on the plastic wrap with a permanent marker to help you remember that you already rolled the dough out four times.Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place on a lightly floured work surface. Roll into a 16 by 8-inch rectangle and fold again like a business letter. Roll out again and fold again. You have now rolled and folded the dough a total of 6 times. Wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.Now the pastry is ready to be rolled and used in the desired puff pastry recipe.Roll dough 1/4&quot; thick and cut it (using a pizza cutter) into 5&quot; squares. Add 1-2 tablespoons of filling in the center, then fold the square in half to form a triangle.Dip a finger in water and run it along the seam and press to close.

Yes, it’s the process is time taking but in return, you will get something great and much better than store-bought.From such simple ingredients — flour, water, butter — greatness comes. Here’s everything you need to know to make puff pastry from scratch.Advertisements   Things you can make with Puff PastryHomemade Chicken PatticeMini Apple Pie PocketsBefore I start making, let’s have some knowledge about Puff Pastry.What is Puff PastryHow to use Puff PastryHow to handle your Puff Pastry?How to store Puff Pastry?Essential Tools for Puff PastryThings to be ConsideredBest Recipes That Use Puff PastryRecipe of Homemade Puff Pastry from ScratchHOMEMADE UNIPUFF SHORT RECIPE What Is Puff Pastry? Puff pastry is a classic pastry dough that has dozens of alternating layers of butter and dough. When baked, those layers puff up and turn into the most delicate, light, golden, buttery flakes of pastry.Advertisements   Making puff pastry involves layering butter between a simple dough of flour and water, then folding it again and again — four to six times total — to create all those hundreds of paper-thin layers. In the oven, the water in the butter and in the dough turns to steam and puffs each layer. What’s left behind is the airy, crispy, buttery creation we call puff pastry. How to Use Puff Pastry? Puff pastry makes super-simple tart shells, easy appetizers, a multitude of desserts, and breakfast pastries. You can bake it into cups for a savory filling, stuff it with fruit to make mouth-watering turnovers, braid it to make a stunning dessert, and even twist it to make cheese straws. How to handle your Puff Pastry? ~ Always keep the dough covered so it does not dry out, and use only as much flour as needed when rolling. Handle the dough as little as possible to prevent the end product from being tough.~ From frozen, whether homemade or store-bought, let the pastry thaw overnight in the refrigerator or for about 30 minutes at room temperature. Do not unfold store-bought pastry while it is still frozen or it may break.~ Once thawed, carefully unfold the dough and roll it out on a lightly floured surface. Should any tears or cracks occur, brush with water and gently press back together. If it starts to soften, pop it back in the fridge for a bit.~ Once rolled or cut to your desired shape, transfer the pastry to your baking sheet before adding in any fillings.~ If you have any leftovers, do not knead them back together. Instead, layer leftover pieces on top of each other, then roll slowly but try not to roll out too much. How to store Puff Pastry? Store fresh, homemade dough in fridge for up to five days — wrap it tightly in plastic wrap. You may freeze prepared dough or ready-to-bake items, like a turnover, for up to three months.The method I’m following uses a block of dough and a block of butter (Unipuff) — along with a series of rolls and folds — to create layers upon layers of pastry. When baked, the butter melts and creates steam, which is then encased and trapped between layers of dough, causing them to separate into dozens of flaky layers. And the result is like, melt-in-your-mouth clouds of flaky goodness!! Essential Tools for Puff Pastry Making puff is a pretty low-tech process — no fancy gadgets or even a stand mixer required. However, there are two tools you really need and that are tricky to replace: a pastry scraper and a French rolling pin.Pastry ScraperThe pastry scraper is used in all the steps: for scraping the flour back into a pile as you make the dough, for nudging the butter into place as you work it, for lifting and moving the pastry as you roll. A pastry scraper also acts as an extension of your hands and fingers, helping you manipulate the dough without warming it up too much with your hands.French Rolling Pin A French rolling pin or a tapered rolling pin is also essential for pounding the butter and making it pliable. So, it is also a very handy and must-have tool. ~ Things to be Considered ~  #1: Making the Lean DoughFirst form a trough down the middle of a pile of dough, add a tablespoon of water, then fluff with your fingers. Keep your fingers loose and use a scooping motion. Repeat, adding water just one tablespoon at a time, until the dough forms shaggy clumps and holds together when pressed. The fluffing process is to ensure that the water gets evenly mixed into the flour and that not too much gluten is formed.#2: Keep the Butter Cold, but PliableThe butter in puff pastry presents a bit of a challenge: you want it to be cold so it stays solid and doesn’t melt into the dough, but you also need it to be pliable so it can be rolled out without breaking into pieces. Cut the cold butter into pieces and begin pounding it with the end of the rolling pin. Scrape the flattened butter up with a pastry scraper, fold it over on itself, and continue pounding and scraping until the butter will bend without breaking, but is still quite cold.Sprinkle the butter with a few teaspoons of flour during this process — some of the liquid in the butter will bead up on the surface as you pound and the flour helps absorb this. Also, rub flour on your rolling pin as needed to prevent it from sticking to the butter.

Yes, it's the process is time taking but in return you will get something great and much better than store-bought.IngredientsFor the dough:All Purpose Flour - 500 grams (more 4 to 5 tablespoons for unipuff) UniPuff - 250 grams, soften (Store-bought or Homemade. I used homemade) (Recipe of UNIPUFF is below!) Salt  - 1 teaspoon Leveled, use less quantity of salt so that you can use in sweet puff pastry items Butter - 2 tablespoons (or  OR ghee can be used) Chilled Water - as required for kneading process Instructions Equipments you Need:Pastry scraperPlastic wrapFrench Rolling Pin How to make Puff Pastry Take a big bowl, add sifted all-purpose flour (500 gram) with salt and mix well.Now add butter and mix with the help of fingertips. (till flour look like crumbs)Then gradually pour water in small quantity and knead a normal soft and smooth dough.Rest dough for about 2 to 3 hours in the refrigerator.Meanwhile, add 3 to 5 table Spoons of all-purpose flour into unipuff  (if using home-made unipuff) and mix well. (Recipe of UNIPUFF is below 👇👇👇)Make a rectangular shape of unipuff again. (but it's up to you, sometimes I do but sometimes I don't, depends on the time) Then refrigerate it and let it cool to semi soften.Now roll the square dough, make sure the center should be thick but all 4 sides should be thin.Place unipuff  in the center of the dough (upside to thick place)Then cover or fold the unipuff with the edges of rolled puff pastry dough. Cover 1 side then opposite side then rest of sides. Pinch slightly to seal. (Remember, remove all air otherwise air bubbles may arise and will destroy your puff pastry!)Then change the dough position (upside down). It means, flip the dough block over, seam side down.Now begin pounding the butter block (inner side) slowly with the rolling pin to soften it.Now Wrap the puff dough in cling film (or wet muslin cloth) and put in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes. (Recommended in hot seasons, otherwise may be skipped or reduced the rest time period in cold areas, (if you are in hurry). But it would be best if you rest your puff pastry after every fold!)First Turn: Dust the worktop lightly with little flour and flip the butter package over so the seams are down. Roll it out to a rectangle roughly 12 inches long by 6 inches wide.Fold from both sides in half and half. (like, two-door cupboard), as shown in images.Then fold half on the other half folded side. (Must check the tutorial images), wrap into cling and refrigerate it for about 20 to 30 minutes or more. (Depends on the weather temperature).Repeat this process 3 more times.Second Turn: Rotate the folded dough so that it looks like a book about to be opened. Roll it out again into a rectangle, 12-inches by 6-inches. Fold it again the same as before we did. Rest the dough in the refrigerator after every fold.Repeat the same process for Third and Fourth Turn, roll out and fold in the same way.After the fourth turn, the dough should feel much more smooth and pliable and should be easy to roll out.If you notice any butter popping up through the dough, pat it with a little flour.Your puff pastry is ready. Wrap in plastic and chill for a final 60 minutes, or overnight.Now you can use right away or you can freeze for upto 3-4 months. whenever you want to use your puff pastry you just need to thaw it only, for half an hour at room temperature then you will be able to make any kind of pies, pinwheels cones, tarts, savory or sweet puffs and much much more!!Step-by-Step Picture Tutorial of Puff PastryPuff Pastry is Ready!!

(it's not an alternative but this option is only for your convenience but better is to make unipuff at home for best results or buy unipuff from a good and reliable store!)If you are using unsalted butter then use chilled butter and grate the butter first, then it's necessary to follow Steps# 5 and 6 of the recipe instructions. 👆👆👆 (which is about flour adding method.)Recipe Notes (Important Points)~ Be calm and gentle! Do not use a rolling pin with the pressure. Roll with slow hands.~ Do not dust too much flour, otherwise, puff pastry will become dry. The good puff pastry should be flaky and crispy but soft inside. After baking you must get perfect light fluffy and flaky result but if you add too much flour to dust you can not achieve good puff pastry after baking.~ When you are adding unipuff and start to fold, that time, please make sure no air is inside. otherwise, when you roll with the air bubbles, your puff pastry might be broken and will fall apart. (Then it would not be easy to handle! So be very careful at the time of rolling the dough.)~ Rest is very necessary (at least 20-30 min) after every rolling and folding.~ If your unipuff is little bit leaking from sides or anywhere else, just add a bit extra flour and fold with slow hands and refrigerate immediately for about 20 to 30 minutes or more.~ Cover the dough completely from all the sides whenever the dough is resting whether in a fridge or in kitchen,  otherwise, dry patches will appear on the dough surface and then will become hard to handle and would be very difficult to manage puff pastry again. (I used cling film wrap to cover pastry dough every time.)~ Always measure the perfect ratio of ingredients, and the perfect ratio of puff pastry is:~ The quantity of all-purpose flour should be doubled from the unipuff.~ Try to make with half the quantity of ingredients first.~ Fold every time from the folded side. NOT from the backside of folded dough.~ If you are folding first from horizontal sides then your next fold should be from vertical. (Example, 1st fold is horizontal, 2nd fold is vertical, 3rd fold is horizontal and the last 4th fold is vertical)🍥HOMEMADE UNIPUFF SHORT RECIPE🍥In a big and deep pot add 1 liter of chilled water with some ice cubes.Now add 1 kg melted ghee or butter into the chilled water.Now use electric beater till butter/ghee changes the color to white and appears in pieces (unipuff)Stop beating and collect all the unipuff from the beater paddles and rest the unipuff for about 2 hours into the chilled water.Now take out all the unipuff in batches & squeeze with the help of your hands. Make sure all water is drained out completely. (For more perfection use a muslin cloth and hang the cloth to drain out all the water just after squeezing with hands.)Now take a square-shaped baking pan. Line with aluminum foil or butter paper. (A bit extra to lift unipuff easily)Freeze unipuff till its solid form.Lift up the unipuff from the pan and cut (with a warm knife) into 4 portions.Each portion of unipuff should between 250 to 300 grams)Voila!! your homemade UNIPUFF is ready!! Use this homemade unipuff in making puff pastry or even in cakes like cake rusk especially. You can freeze this unipuff up to 3-4 months in the freezer if not using right away.We all love to eat puff pastry snacks, but it takes some true commitment if you are going to make your own. This labor-intensive pastry dough takes nearly four hours to make from scratch. It’s Okay!! Most of that time is inactive — letting the dough rest and chill in the fridge — but it will demand your time, attention, and patience.Now it's your turn to make your own puff pastry!

Did you know that today would be Julia Child’s 105th
birthday?



In honor of the culinary great’s birthday, I joined a few of
my blogging friends to cook up some Julia-inspired recipes.



Where better, I thought, than to start off by reading Julie and Julia?  






And wow.



What a disappointment that was.  I really should have researched the book more
before picking it up.  I naively assumed
that the book would chronical more of Julia Child’s life (rather, the author’s narcissistic
narrative was abruptly interrupted by an unrelated imagined scene from Julia
Child’s younger years).  Instead the book
followed miserable secretary, Julie Powel in her pursuit to cook all of the
recipes from Julia Child’s Mastering the
Art of French Cooking in one year. 
What was meant to be endearing and comical simply wasn’t.  Basically, Julie flounders through life
hating her job, she claims to be happily married but treats her husband like
garbage, and has the housekeeping skills to make most maids turn heel and run.  



Oh, and there weren’t any recipes *cries*



Needless to say, I wasn’t a fan.



But what I gleaned from the book was a) what I really wanted
was a memoir/biography about Julia Child (this was so not it), b) I want to
check out Mastering the Art of French
Cooking from the library (it’s always checked out!) and c) butter.



It seems that most of the recipes in both books include
copious amount of butter, which got me thinking of one of my bucket list
recipes: Puff pastry.  






It’s one of those ingredients that seems to show up time and
time again.  I feel like I’m constantly passing
over recipes that use puff pastry, because I just don’t want to buy the frozen
stuff.  I don’t know why, but I just
don’t like the idea of frozen pastry dough!



So without even ever having experience with frozen puff
pastry dough, I decided to tackle the homemade version!




Looking at the recipe, I found that puff pastry dough is
actually quite similar in process to croissant dough.  In both recipes, the butter is laminated
between dough layers.  In the laminating
process, the dough is folded and rolled over and over again to create hundreds
of flaky layers.  Eventually, during the
baking process, the watery part of the butter evaporates creating the puffy
flakiness.



The real key to the process, other than ample chilling time,
is the butter, which need to be cold, yet pliable.  In fact, there is even a special rolling pin
that is used for beating the butter into submission.



I, however, do not have the magic butter bat.  But as I thought about it, the cold yet
pliable descriptor reminded me a lot of homemade butter.  After cream has been amply beaten to create
butter and buttermilk, it is kneaded in ice water to remove and residual
buttermilk and it’s cold & pliable.



Plus, back when I was researching croissant recipes, I
learned that different butters have different fat contents and that for
croissants, the higher that fat content, the better.  I also learned that most commercial butters
in the US are on the lower end of the spectrum, whereas some of the spendier
European butters or homemade butter are on the higher end.



I used homemade butter in my croissants, and decided to do the
same with the puff pastry.



I used this particular puff pastry to make some pot pies
(I’ll share that recipe later) but just look at those flaky layers!!!    Ahhh!  
What started off at around a quarter-inch puffed up to over an inch
tall!  Plus, it was soo incredibly
buttery and delicious!



Puff pastry is a rather time consuming process, but it is
totally worth it in the end!

Don't miss these great Julia-inspired recipes!

Homemade Puff
Pastry

Adapted from the Kitchn



Homemade Butter

1 quart heavy cream



Puff pastry

2 cups all purpose flour

1 tsp salt

2/3 cup ice water

8 oz homemade butter





Start by making the dough.



Place the flour & salt on a work surface, and mix
together.  Create a well, and add 1
tablespoon of water, scoop and fluff the flour to mix in the water.  Repeat the steps, creating a well, adding 1 tablespoon
water, fluffing, & scooping until a shaggy dough is created.



Dough is ready when the dough clumps together and holds when
pressed together.  Wrap the dough in plastic
wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes or more.



While you make the dough, place the butter in the bowl of a
stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. 
Turn the mixer to high and beat until the butter separates from the
buttermilk.



Drain off the buttermilk (and make English muffins!!)  Squeeze the butter to release any additional
buttermilk, then place in a bowl of ice water. 
Knead the butter in the ice water, replacing water as it becomes
cloudy.  Once the water stays clear, pat
the butter dry and shape into a 4x4 inch square.  Refrigerate for 5-10 minutes.



Remove the dough from the refrigerator and roll into a 9x9 inch
square.  Place the butter block off-set
in the center (the corners will be at an angle to the corners of the
dough).  Fold the corners of the dough
over and pinch to seal.



Liberally dust the work surface, flip the dough, seam side
down and roll into a 12x6 inch rectangle. 



Fold the dough like a letter, flip ninety degrees and roll to
12x6 again.  Fold like a letter, then
wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.



Roll to 12x6 and fold like a letter twice more and
refrigerate for 30 minutes.



Again, roll to 12x6 and fold like a letter twice more and
refrigerate 60 minutes or overnight.



Roll the dough to ¼ in thick, then use as desired.

Every time I go to the store I look for puff pastry, however they never have it.  I started reading about how to make it from scratch and the “classic” recipe seemed to take a lot of work and time.  So I kept looking and then I found this recipe from King Arthur Flour that sounded so easy and it didn’t take all day either!  I tweaked it a little, gave it a try and I’m so happy that I did.  It turned out wonderful and it was so simple to make.  Plus the end result is so flaky and buttery!  Once you try this, you’ll never go back to store bought again!  It was early morning so I decided to fill mine with cream cheese and strawberry preserves… like a toaster strudel.  I’m looking forward to trying it with so many other fillings too!
 
 

Ingredients are as follows:
 
1 3/4 C flour
1/4 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. baking powder
1 Tbsp. sugar
1 C butter, frozen and cut into slices
1/2 C sour cream
 
6 ounces cream cheese, softened
1/4 C sugar
1 tsp. vanilla
 
Strawberry preserves
 
 
Directions:
 
Preheat oven to 400 degrees; have a cookie sheet ready.
 
Mix together the flour, salt, baking powder and sugar; add the butter.
 

 
Cut the butter into the flour mixture (do not over mix, bigger chunks are better).
 

 
 
Add the sour cream and mix until moistened.
 

   
Pour out onto a floured surface; quickly knead it until it sticks together.
 

 
Roll out into a rectangle (mine was about 12″ x 13″).
 

 
Fold down the top half then flip up the bottom half.
 

 
Fold in both sides.
 

 
Roll out into another rectangle and repeat the folds one more time.  See the difference between the top picture and the bottom picture?  The second picture is much smoother.  Wrap in plastic wrap and place in the fridge for 30 minutes or you could freeze it at this point.
 

Mix the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla together.


Remove dough from the fridge and roll out into a square.


Trim the edges of the dough and cut into six pieces.





Place a dollop of cream cheese and preserves at one end of the dough.





Cut three little slits into the other end of the dough.

Moisten the edges of the dough (with water) then fold the bottom half over the cream cheese/preserves and crimp the edges to seal.

Continue with the remaining dough and place onto a baking sheet.

Bake for 20-25 minutes; until golden brown.
 

Take a bite and enjoy!

51,https://www.myhumblekitchen.com/2009/06/hojaldre-puff-pastry-dough/,"Puff pastry is extremely popular in Spanish cooking. It’s used for desserts and with meat or fish fillings for main courses or tapas.The recipe below is from one of my Spanish cookbooks by Penelope Casas, The Foods and Wines of Spain. It’s an easy and foolproof method adapted by the one and only Julia Child. This is a recipe that can be made and stored in your freezer.Puff Pastry, Hojaldre  Makes 2 3/4 poundsIngredients3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour1 cup cake flour1 1/2 teaspoons salt6 1/2 sticks chilled unsalted butter1 cup iced waterMix together the all-purpose and cake flours. Stir in the saltCut the sticks of butter in half lengthwise, then in half again, lengthwise. Cut into 1/2 inch cubes and add to the flour mixture.Rub the cubes of butter between your fingers to flatten them into flakes, combining them at the same time with the flour.Refrigerate the mixture 10 minutes. The butter must be kept firm throughout the process.Add the cold water and stir until the dough roughly holds together. (The dough will still be chunky and by no means look like a tightly formed ball of dough.) Turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface.Pat into a rectangle about 18 inches long and 8 inches wide.Sprinkle the top of the dough with flour and fold one side over the top, then fold over the other side.Lift the dough, flour the work surface again, flour the top of the dough, then roll out with a rolling pin to the previous size, making the folded sides the width and the open sides the length. Remember, all of this must be done rapidly – if the butter softens, refrigerate briefly.Fold up a second time, in the same manner, roll out again, then repeat 2 more times, flouring surfaces as necessary and ending with the dough folded.Wrap in plastic wrap or parchment paper and refrigerate for 40 minutes.Roll and fold twice more, and the dough is ready to use or to store for future use in the refrigerator or freezer.

52,https://foodcrumbles.com/puff-pastry-science-of-flaky-layers/,"In a bowl, weigh out the flour, egg, water and salt. Knead together into a smooth dough. There is no need to form a lot of gluten, so you don't have to knead it as extensively as bread. Knead it until it has come together into a soft flexible ball. Add more water or flour if you need it. The final dough shouldn't be sticky.Cover the dough and leave it to rest for 15 minutes. Don't skip this wait! During this wait your gluten will relax again making it a whole lot easier to roll out your dough. If it is warm in your working area, store the dough in the fridge, also store it in the fridge if you're planning to wait a little longer (max. 2 hours) before using it.Take your butter and place it in between two large sheets of plastic foil. Using a dough roller, smash the butter into a flat disk (approx. 1/2 cm thick). Try to keep it in a rectangular shape, that will make the next step easier. Store the butter in the fridge until you use it.Roll out the dough into a rectangle about twice the length of the butter slab.Place the butter slab on one side of the dough and fold the other half of the dough over the slab. Close of the edges of the dough to ensure that no butter is sticking out.Roll out the slab into a long rectangle again. If you need to, gently cover with flour. For all the next several steps you want to limit your use of flouring the dough, however, do use enough to prevent it from sticking to the counter since that will make your life more complicated. It is best to gently sprinkle with flour before starting to roll again, that way the flour gets incorporated during rolling and won't prevent the layers from sticking together after folding.Make a bookfold (see photo below of the side of the dough after a bookfold), along the long side of the dough you fold the top quarter inside, same for the bottom quarter. Your rectangle should now be half the size it was at the start with the two pieces of dough coming together in the middle. Now fold it double one more time.Wrap the dough in a plastic bag or plastic foil and leave to rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. No problem to leave it in for a couple of hours until you go to the next step.Take the dough out of the fridge and immediately start rolling it into a rectangle again. You want to have the dough turn 90 degrees compared to how you folded it up. You do this to make sure that the outsides that might not yet contain as many butter layers are now included into the fold.Repeat the bookfold from the previous fold.Turn the dough 90 degrees again, one quarter, roll out into a long rectangle again and fold again.Cover it back in the plastic and leave to rest in the fridge for another 30-60 minutes.Repeat the rolling and folding, do it two times again. If you're starting to get trouble rolling and folding, you can also switch to a letter fold here. you will get three instead of 4 layers of dough here. In that case fold in the same orientation as you would do for a bookfold. Take the right 1/3 of the dough and fold it over the middle 1/3. Now take the left 1/3 of your dough and fold it over as well.Place it back in the fridge, covered in plastic. It is now ready to use. If you want you can freeze it until you're planning to use it. Otherwise, leave it to rest at least another 30 minutes in the fridge before rolling it out.How to bake it depends on the recipe, we baked it at 200C (400F) for 25 minutes until it was nice and crispy and a light brown. You should see the sides puffing up.",puff_pastry

Scatter the cubed, cold butter over the top of the flour along with the salt. Use your fingertips to run the butter into the flour using a pinching motion between your fingertips and thumbs. Once the mixture looks evenly crumbly, you can stop.Gather the crumbly flour-butter mixture into a mound on the work surface and make a wide well in the middle of it. Pour in half of the water and use your fingertips to gently bring flour from the edges into the centre, incorporating the water, to start making a dough.Once it looks dry, make a well again and drizzle in the remaining water. Keep gently kneading until you get a dry but cohesive dough. You may need to drizzle some extra water in if the dough is looking too dry - do this 1 tablespoon at a time until there are only a few floury patches remaining in the dough. Set aside.Take the frozen butter that's been sitting out and grate on a box grater, using the side with the largest holes.Roll the dough out into an 8 x 13 inch (20 x 33 cm) rectangle, dusting with flour if needed to prevent the dough sticking to the surface.",puff_pastry

Most of us usually think of puff pastry when it comes to dessert, but sometimes forget about how many ways it can be used in savory ways. The most classic types of appearance for puff pastry in a savory dish might be atop a chicken or other pot pie, or wrapping a piece of meat or Beef Wellington (such a delightfully old fashioned dish, that I may need to make for my boyfolk soon).
But recently I came up with these puff pastry croutons, and mighty pleased with myself I was. You can cut them into any shape you like, or just sliced the puff pastry freehand into squares or diamonds.





You can make big or small croutons…. the big ones might be lovely floating atop some creamy chicken and vegetables filling (back to that pot pie concept), or a soup of pretty much any sort, or a stew (I am going to float a big flat puff pastry circle on a bowl of this Provencal Fish Stew in the near future for sure).

When I first came up with these, it was for a holiday salad that I was making, and I used these baby leaf cookie cutters, which are extremely cute and extremely autumnal. For Halloween, little pumpkin shapes or ghosts or what not would be awesome. Hearts for Valentine’s Day, Christmas trees for Christmas. Stars for Fourth of July. And little fluted circles or diamonds or anything you like for other days. You can find endless cookie cutter shape varieties online and wherever baking tools are sold.





These are amazingly easy to make. If you are using frozen puff pastry, defrost it according to package directions. Refrigerated puff pastry dough is also available, which I think is a gift—immediate gratification—is there anything more… gratifying?
Store-bought puff pastry turns into easy flaky croutons, great for adding to a salad or a bowl of soup.Tweet This

How to Make Puff Pastry Croutons
1. Preheat the oven to 400°F.

2. Lightly roll (or unroll) the puff pastry out onto a parchment-paper lined baking sheet.
If your puff pastry is frozen, it will need to be defrosted according to package directions.  Thicker puff pastry should be lightly rolled out onto a parchment-paper lined baking sheet.  The refrigerated version doesn’t need any rolling; it’s the right thickness right out of the package. Use cookie cutters to cut the desired shapes or just slice the puff pastry into squares or diamond shapes.

3. Option: Remove any excess dough.
You can remove any excess dough surrounding the shapes if you used cookie cutters, or you can just leave the shapes in place in the sheet of dough. If you decide to remove the excess dough your croutons will be slightly browned on the top and the sides, and if you leave the shapes in the sheet of dough the will just brown on top, and you will need to pop them out of the baked dough once they are done. Either way works fine, but the freestanding shapes will probably cook faster than the full sheet of dough.

4. Brush the top of the dough with a light wash.
You can brush the top of the dough with a light wash of mayonnaise for additional shine and golden brown color. A beaten egg yolk and/or a tablespoon or two of melted butter also work as a glaze, but the mayo is like a cross between brushing them with egg and melted butter, both classic options for making pastry glossy and nicely browned. If you are brushing cut-out shapes try and just brush the tops of the shapes, so the mayo doesn’t hamper the way the layered pastry rises.

5. Sprinkle the puff pastry dough with kosher salt or Parmesan or other seasonings.
After that, sprinkle them with a tiny bit of kosher salt. You can also add things like a sprinkle of Parmesan, or some sesame or poppy seeds, or even some dried herbs or other spices. This is a great way to play around with the herbs and spices in your pantry – match the flavors to the dish you will be adding the croutons to.
6. Bake for 10 to 20 minutes.
Bake anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes—small freestanding shapes will take the least amount of time, the whole sheet of pastry will take the longest. When the croutons are golden brown and flaky they are done. Test one to be sure.





And look—adorable little puff pastry croutons!
These work every which way. They work when you leave the dough in place around the cut outs, and they work when you peel up the excess puff pastry and leave the cut out silhouetted on the parchment paper (and then you get to eat the its and pieces of the baked pastry surrounding the shapes. They also keep in a sealed container for a few days, so you can make them ahead, and use them as the mood strikes. They also make great snacks—pair them with a glass of wine for a classy little hors d’ouevre.

Chill bowls of flour and butter for 10 &ndash; 15 minutes in the freezer.

Separate the chunks of butter with your fingertips- work quickly, and place it in the bowl of flour.

Once all of the butter is in the bowl with the flour and salt, take a butter knife and coat the butter with the flour, and throw in a little chopping action! Not too much chopping, just so every piece of butter is coated.

Dump the contents of your bowl onto your work surface. Preferably a marble board or metal counter (you can even use a chilled baking sheet), but use whatever clean work surface you have. Just keep in mind you&rsquo;ll need a lot of flour and you will need to work very quickly.

Form the pile of flour and butter into a well.

Pour in a few tablespoons of the ice water at first. Mix with your fingertips.

You can test the mixture by gently squeezing a small handful. When it has the proper texture, it will hold together without crumbling apart.

If it doesn&rsquo;t come together, dribble in a few tablespoons more of the ice water until everything forms into a dough. Remember to work quickly and to use your fingertips! You don&rsquo;t want tough pastry! (Note: Depending on the brand of flour you are using and the weather conditions, you will not need all of the water called for in this recipe- I ended up using about 9 tablespoons of water.)

Knead the dough for 30 seconds.

Form the dough into a square. This is when you may want to wrap the square of dough in plastic wrap, and place it in the refrigerator for about &frac12; hour (until firm), but depending on how hot and humid it is in your kitchen, you may not need to.

After the dough is formed into a square, roll it out into a 15-by-8-inch rectangle. Fold the short ends over the middle (like a letter) to make three layers. This is the first turn.

Give the dough a quarter turn and roll away from you into another 15-by-8-inch rectangle. Fold the short ends over the middle to make 3 layers. This is the second turn. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap; refrigerate for 30 minutes or place the dough into the freezer for 15-20 minutes (again, if it&rsquo;s not too hot in your kitchen and you are working quickly- you can skip the refrigeration step and immediately go to the next 2 turns)

Repeat the process for the steps of folding (and giving the dough &frac14; turns) to create the third and fourth turns. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before use (or up to 3 days).",puff_pastry

Lay another piece of wax paper on top and smooth out the square &amp; straighten the sides. Peel back each wax paper sheet &amp; re-lay as it wrinkles to keep a smooth, even surface. After block's thickness &amp; sides are even, refrigerate until firm.Make the dough:&nbsp;Sift flour onto your work surface (preferably something chilly like granite or marble slab) Pinch butter into chunks and place on top of flour. Continue pinching butter into flour until it resembles coarse crumbs.Shape into a mound, then make a well in the center of the mound. Add the salt &amp; cold water into the well, then with a fork, use a whisking motion to gradually incorporate the well's sides into the water. When it starts to form a solid mass, finish incorporating the flour by kneading. Incorporate just until it is still sticky and has a rough texture. Adjust the water &amp; flour as needed. Try to knead as little as possible. Puff pastry likes lazy kneaders.Form dough into a ball, remember-knead as little as possible. Flatten the ball a bit, then cut a cross halfway through the dough. Wrap it up &amp; let rest in fridge for 30 minutes.You'll want the Butter Block to have approximately the same consistency as the Dough, after the dough is rested. You don't want the butter rock hard, but not mushy soft, either. A dough that is softer than the butter will stretch while the butter doesn't. If the butter is softer than the dough, it will be pushed out the sides. Either create&nbsp;difficulties to some degree. You may have to adjust chill/resting times for either dough or butter block so they are about the same. Kitchen temp., how long it took to make the dough, fridge temp., all affect the consistency of the Butter Block &amp; Dough. Figure out adjustments to make so they'll work together homogeneously. It may take a time or two, but you'll get the hang of it. While everything is chilling, get to work. Clean that kitchen up. Then relax &amp; get ready to assemble.Assembly:&nbsp;Pull the corners of the cuts out of the dough ball to make a square shape. Roll the dough out to a square slightly thicker in the center than on the sides, and slightly larger than the butter block.Place the butter block diagonally on the dough square, so that the butter corners are pointed at the middle of the dough sides. Fold the uncovered dough corners over the butter block to completely envelop the butter. Pinch the seams tightly together to seal in the butter.Dust your work surface with flour, and roll the dough into a rectangle about 1/2"" thick. Remember to keep dusting with flour whenever needed to keep the dough from sticking &amp; tearing the layers.Size up your rectangle visually into 3. Fold one third over the middle, then fold the opposite third over. Just like a tri-fold brochure. Try to have everything as even as possible. All the edges should match fairly closely. Put on a plate, cover, and refrigerate for about 30 minutes. Relax, read the paper, check email, whatever you like.Roll out to 1/2"" thick and repeat the fold. Don't forget to flour as you roll. Plate, cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Repeat this for a total five roll &amp; folds.After the last fold, roll the rectangle out to about 3/4"". If it is difficult, put dough in the fridge for a bit to relax the gluten. If using immediately, cover, rest in fridge for about 30 minutes, then use as needed. If it's for later, cut into sections big enough but that still fit easily in your freezer (usually just in half), layer with wax paper between sections, freezer bag it, &amp; store until needed.",puff_pastry

As I was learning to bake, there were a number of pastries that intimidated me. The ingredients were familiar, but the techniques in which they were combined left me with a nervous feeling in the pit of my stomach. I avoided these sweet treats, placing them at the bottom of the baking list for a day when I felt adventurous. Even now, there are a few pastries I still shy away from (I'm looking at you, macarons). My first fear was scones. After a few batches, some failed and some successful, the routine grew comfortable, and they have remained trouble-free since. The second fear was pie crust. This one took quite a bit little longer to conquer. It wasn't until I realized my hands were a better mixing tool than any machine that the dough came together beautifully. Puff pastry is another of the pastry basics that intimidated me for many years. It is less of the technique that discourages me, and more of the sheer amount of time it takes to make laminated dough  (which can be days between the folding, rolling, and resting). I am impatient when it comes to pastry. Today, however, my impatience is a virtue because it resulted in this recipe for quick puff pastry. This flaky pastry can be mixed together in less than 30 minutes and has a puff that rivals that of the actual laminated dough.























To begin, all-purpose flour is mixed with salt and baking powder. Pastry purists may tell you that baking powder has no business in puff pastry, where the flaky layers should come from the butter alone. However, since this is a quick puff pastry, I figured anything that can give a little extra height on our pastry is welcome.Cold, cubed butter is cut into the flour with a French technique known as fraisage. The butter is coated in flour and flattened with the heel of your hand, smearing it against the surface away from you. This process is repeated enough to flatten the butter cubes just once—perhaps a dozen times total. You don't want to overdo this step. The butter should still be quite large in size when finished (about the size of your thumbnail); large butter pieces helps provide those coveted flaky layers. If you overdo this step, the butter may melt and you will lose the flaky layers in the final product.







When you are finished cutting the butter into the flour, it should look similar to the image on the top left. Bring the dough together, form a well in the center, and pour in half of the ice cold water. Using a dough scraper, combine the water and flour. It may be a bit messy at first, but it will come together. Be careful not to over-mix the dough. Repeat with the remaining water. Then, form the dough into a square with floured hands.































The dough is rolled out into a 10 by 12-inch rectangle. If there is extra flour on the top, brush it off. Extra flour can make the flaky layers stick together, preventing them from reaching full height. Next, fold the dough into thirds, like you would do with a letter, continuing to brush off extra flour as you go. Then, flip the dough over and rotate it 90 degrees. The entire rolling and folding process is repeated another 4-5 times. Make sure to fold and rotate the dough in the same direction each time, to ensure a full rotation.This folding and rolling process is what creates the flakiness of puff pastry. The butter is flattened into very thin layers so when the pastry hits the heat of the oven, the butter will melt, leaving space between the layers and creating the flaky appearance and texture. The dough should be wrapped and chilled for 30 minutes before using so the moisture in the dough can be distributed evenly and the butter can harden firmly.The dough can be left in the refrigerator up to 3 days or frozen for several months before using. If frozen, thaw the dough in the refrigerator the night before for use the next day.

This may be my year of making things I didn't think I'd ever attempt to make! From bagels to English muffins (both of which I've now made several times), I moved on to...puff pastry.  At least, it's a simplified, easy puff pastry recipe - what's been called the ""rough puff"".


Incidentally, I can't stop saying ""rough puff"" after hearing the term.  So what makes it a rough puff?  Well, rather than having to go through the intricate and very time-consuming process of rolling out a butter packet and incorporating it into the dough, folding, rolling, and repeating the process several times between refrigeration (reasons I've never been tempted to try making puff pastry), this dough starts off a bit like pie dough and comes together in no time.  We're talking 15 minutes if you're efficient and maybe more like 30 minutes if you're not, like me!

This recipe is another I learned about from the fabulous site, Dessert for Two.  As you can gather from the photos above, cubes of butter are cut into the flour, then brought together with ice water to form a rough dough.  You roll the dough out into a rectangle, fold it like a letter, give it a quarter turn, then roll it out again.  Repeat this process of folding, turning, and rolling 6-7 times (no refrigerating in between) and you have your rough puff pastry dough.  


You don't need me to tell you there are so many uses for puff pastry.  I decided to take my rough puff and use it to make some shortcut chocolate croissants (or pains au chocolat) and chocolate-almond croissants.  I've done it before using store-bought puff pastry. 

True croissants involve leavened dough.  It's basically a cross between a yeasted dough and butter-layered dough like puff pastry.  The result is a stretchy, chewy, yet flaky texture, that's, of course, encased in buttery richness.  For a shortcut, puff pastry alone will due here.  I filled the dough generously with chopped dark chocolate, and for the almond version, I tucked in a bit of almond paste as well.   


The rough puff I made may not have boasted tons of layers but the result was very similar to what I get when I use store-bought puff pastry for this purpose.  My family really enjoy my endeavor and the rough puff was truly surprisingly easy. This experience may help me work up the courage to branch out even further...maybe try my hand at actually making a small batch of homemade croissants (or chocolate croissants) one of these days!


Onto the logistics - the easy puff pastry dough starts with flour, salt, and diced unsalted butter.  Use a rich, high-quality European-style butter; I used Plugra.  


Cut the butter into the dry ingredients until you have a coarse texture, with little pea-size lumps of butter in the mixture.  I start with a pastry cutter, then finish with my fingers.


One-third cup of ice cold water goes in.  Stir together to form a rough dough, then turn the dough out onto a floured surface.  I don't know about you but whenever I read something like ""...shape the dough into a rough square"", I make a rectangle.  Make a square if you can.


Now, start rolling the dough into a rectangle about 10 inches long.  At first, you still see chunks of butter in the dough but as you fold and roll, the dough smooths out and becomes very easy to work with. 


Fold the dough like a letter.  In other words, fold the bottom third of the dough over the middle of the dough and the top third on top of the middle.  Give it a quarter turn.  It should look like this:


Then you repeat the process.  Roll it out again to a 10-inch long rectangle, fold it, give it a quarter turn and repeat this about 6 times or so (more if you're having fun like I was).  Add flour as you go along to prevent sticking. 


As you can see above, by the time you're done, the dough is smooth and you no longer see the chunks of butter.  I have a habit of rolling dough out on a sheet of parchment paper (easy cleanup).  I will say that given all the rolling that takes place here, the parchment got a bit wrinkled, along with the dough.  It's not a big deal but for a totally smooth surface, I'd skip the parchment paper next time. 


Once your rough puff pastry is done, wrap it up and let it rest at least one hour, or overnight, before using.  I saved this little project for a rainy morning and that night, I used the dough and prepped them for my shortcut chocolate and chocolate-almond croissants for the next morning's breakfast.  

I decided to cut my sheet of rough puff into 6 pieces to make six pastries.


I tucked a fairly generous amount (a little shy of an ounce) of chocolate into each rectangle...


For the chocolate-almond ones, I used less chocolate and added a little less than an ounce of almond paste into each.  


To seal, I folded them like an envelop, with a little water (or egg wash) to help it stick together. 


You can prep these the night before like I did.  Place them seam side down onto a parchment lined baking sheet and cover tightly with plastic wrap before storing in the refrigerator.  When you're ready to bake, preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Take the tray out of the fridge, brush the tops of each with egg wash.  For the chocolate-almond ones, I placed some sliced almonds on top.  


Bake for about 20 minutes, until the pastries are puffed and golden.  


Waking up to a warm homemade pastry is pretty neat!  My family really appreciated it.  


My son favors the plain chocolate but for my husband and I, the warm, fragrant, chewy almond paste nestled inside the almond ones just can't be beat.  




************************************************************
Cooking and baking is really such a comfort.  Digging out of the nor'easter we had recently, I'm very thankful we didn't lose power and I could continue my ""baking therapy sessions"" as needed.  It's really fun to try new dishes for dinner and when it comes to baking, I continue to bake up family favorites and trying a few new things like the rough puff pastry in between.  

Recently, we seem to be having a moment with rice krispies treats at my house.  I made chocolates ones during Valentine's Day and continuing my love affair with recipes from Dessert for Two, I made peanut butter rice krispies, which I have to show you because they just make me smile!


Boy oh boy, peanut butter rice krispies are incredibly good!  Plain and chocolates ones are amazing, too.  I'm learning to have more fun and get more creative with it.  I really recommend making any variety and reminding yourself how good they are.  


During the snow storm, I also tried Christina's cookies and cream cupcakes.  I'd been eyeing it because my son loves Oreo cookies.  Not surprisingly, the cupcakes were a hit (I find desserts are very welcomed during snow days!).


And right now, we're working our way through Ina Garten's chocolate cake, which I baked today.  When it comes to comfort food of the sweet variety, I always think of a classic chocolate layer cake like that one.  It's a serious family favorite.  Tonight, we had a nice family dinner of Spanish-style yellow rice with chicken and kielbasa sausage and wrapped things up with the cake for dessert.  First thing in the morning, I'll be baking a double batch of coffee cake muffins.  For now, good night and be well!

Recipe:

Easy Puff Pastry (""Rough Puff)
From Dessert for Two

- Makes 1 sheet of puff pastry (to use as desired*) - 

1 cup (125 grams) all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon fine salt
10 tablespoons (5 ounces) high-quality unsalted butter, cold and cut into cubes
1/3 cup ice cold water

In a medium bowl, combine the flour and salt.  Add butter and using a pastry cutter and/or your fingertips, cut the butter into the dry ingredients until you have a crumbly dough with uniform pieces of pea-size butter.

Make a hole in the center of the bowl and add the ice water.  Stir together with a fork until you have a rough dough. 

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Pat the dough into a rough square.  You will see chunks of butter in the dough and while the dough may seem dry, do not add any more water; it will come together as you roll.

Dust a rolling pin with flour and use it to roll the dough out into a rectangle about 10 inches long.  Fold the bottom third of the dough over the middle and the top third also over the middle (like you would fold a letter).  Rotate the dough one-quarter turn and repeat.  Use additional flour, as needed, to prevent sticking.  

Roll-out, fold, and turn the dough at least 6-7 more times.  Then, wrap the dough and chill for at least 1 hour, or overnight.  You can also freeze the dough.  

Roll the puff pastry dough out for desired use.  

* To make shortcut chocolate croissants like I did, roll the dough out into a 12x12 inch square.  Make six 4x6 inch rectangles by cutting the dough straight down the middle and then making two cuts across, once every 4 inches.  With the short side of each rectangle facing you, place some chopped dark chocolate or chocolate chips in the middle.  Fold the bottom third over the chocolate, wet the top of the dough with some water and fold that over to seal.  Place seam side down onto a parchment lined baking sheet.  For chocolate-almond croissants, I use a little less chocolate and added about 3/4 ounce of almond paste as the filling.  Before baking, brush pastries with egg wash; bake at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes, until golden and puffed.

Making gluten free puff pastry is a snap, when you have the right recipe. If you’ve ever had trouble understanding the butter packet, or the “turns” that create all those flaky layers, a how-to video is just the thing you need.



If you can make gluten free pie crust, then you can make gluten free puff pastry. And you can make pie crust. I promise. There are a few basic principles to keep in mind whenever you’re making any pastry of any kind. Gluten free or not.
First, everything should be kept cold—but not rock solid cold. That is especially true when it comes to puff pastry, as opposed to, say, gluten free biscuits. The larger the piece of butter you’re working with, the warmer it can be without causing problems. Let me explain.

Puff pastry is made by creating a simple pie crust, and wrapping it around a packet made entirely of 1 whole cup of butter. Once the large packet of butter is wrapped in the pie crust, it’s rolled out into a rectangle. The first “turn” is simply the first time the dough-wrapped butter packet is rolled out into a rectangle and folded in thirds.
After that first turn, the tripled dough is made up of 3 layers of butter surrounded in alternating fashion by 6 layers of dough. When the turns are repeated between 4 and 6 times, the layers multiply exponentially.

In pastry-making, the butter is kept cold before going into the hot oven. Like ice, when butter is cold, it contracts or is made smaller. When it is heated quickly, like in an oven, it expands. When the butter is in many, many layers, and is surrounded on every side by the dough, it pushes out the dough and creates all those flaky layers we love.
Larger pieces of butter can warm, but once chilled will regain their original shape, rather than melting into the surrounding dough. If you try to shape the butter packet when the butter is rock solid, you’ll find it almost impossible to shape.
If you being with slightly warmer butter in creating the packet, you can shape it as you like, and then chill it until it’s firm. It will then retain its proper shape during the rest of the shaping—and during baking.

This puff pastry can be frozen for months (just defrost overnight in the refrigerator before using), and is easiest to work with when it’s been sitting out on the counter for about 10 minutes.
Use it for super easy sweet desserts, like the open apple tart you see above. Or make it savory, like I did by making puff pastry cups. I topped them with the filling from the Spanakopita Bites in my new cookbook, Gluten Free Small Bites. They’re also lovely just filled with pastry cream or whipped cream and some fresh berries.

65,https://www.oandoeats.com/home/2018/4/18/puff-pastry,"It has been over a year. One year and some change. The big question: what happened to 2017? Among other things, lots of vacations (Tokyo! Miami! Italy!), fighting to close the gender wage gap at my old job, calling bankrupt and spending the entire summer finding a new job (sidebar: if you ever want to reach out and talk about being a woman in the tech industry, send me a message—let's break those goddamn glass ceilings!), binge watching tv shows (The Great British Bake Off might have inspired this post), but most of all, just taking some much needed time off.This first post back is a big one. We're making full puff pastry today, complete lamination and all. You'll find that a quick online search for ""puff pastry recipe"" yields mostly rough puff recipes, which forgoes the full lamination process in favor of essentially making a pie dough as the base. I however am a fan of full puff to get the most delicate layers possible, but also because it is really not as difficult or time consuming as some of its naysayers would have you believe. Yes, you do have to chill your dough after every two turns to prevent the butter from melting, but you have to do the same with rough puff. That said, I won't try to convince you this is easy, it is definitely more of a day-ahead recipe since homemade puff pastry is best used after an overnight chill, but once it's ready, the possibilities are endless.















































Circling back to GBBO, some of the things the bakers were asked to make were so obscure. Like what the dang hell is a religieuse à l'ancienne? Apparently a tower of eclairs shaped like a nun...say what? But I digress. After watching all the episodes available on Netflix, I went and re-watched all the pastry week episodes about three more times, much to Phillip's chagrin (""No more baking show, PLEASE""). Pastry is my favorite because it's mesmerizing how the simple combination of butter + flour + water can make such delicious vessels for anything sweet or savory. Cream horns (teehee) anyone?In this recipe, I'm sharing with you how to make a puff pastry, but not all the different things you can make with it—this post would be 100 pages long if so. You can see from the photos that some of the things we ended up making were palmier cookies and vol-au-vents, which are apparently a very 1970s hors d'oeuvre that I really want to come back in vogue. I'll provide links to a few recipes that use puff pastry in the notes below. Other than that, enjoy the puff! It's good to be back y'all!







































Notes:The recipe below makes a double batch of full puff pastry, I like to do it that way because you can always freeze half for easy use in future recipes. Feel free to halve the recipe if you only need one batch though.The key to any pastry, but especially for puff pastry, is keeping your ingredients cold. So work quickly and calmly. If at any point you sense the butter melting, don't hesitate to place your dough in the fridge to firm up.Pictured in this post are:- vol-au-vents I cut my vol-au-vents smaller than the linked recipe, using a 2 & 1/2 inch crinkled cookie cutter, with 1 inch cutouts for the rings. The ones pictured above are stuffed with a store bought smoked whitefish salad and pan fried asparagus.- palmiersYou can also make many other things such as:- hand pies my favorite are ham and cheddar, or sweet corn, cheddar, and scallion for a vegetarian version- cheese twists- mille feuilleIngredients:4 cups (500 grams) all purpose flour, plus more for dusting2 tsp salt1 & 1/4 cups water, plus more as needed2 cups (1 lb) unsalted butter, coldInstructions:Make the dough by combining flour, salt, and water in a large mixing bowl. Mix with a large spoon until it forms a rough, shaggy dough. If it's too dry, add more water a tablespoon at a time until the dough mostly comes together but is not sticky. Transfer to a lightly floured counter and knead for 2 to 3 minutes. You don't want to overwork the dough. It should be smooth-ish at this point, but not completely smooth, so don't worry if it looks slightly lumpy. Roughly form the dough into a flattened square, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate while you prepare the butter.Place the butter on a well floured counter. Pound it with a rolling pin until somewhat flattened. Fold the butter on top of itself and and keep pounding/flattening, sprinkling with more flour as needed so it doesn't stick to the counter or the rolling pin. Once you've repeated the folding and flattening process enough for the butter to be malleable enough to fold over without cracking, it's ready. Take a large piece of parchment paper and wrap the butter in it, forming a 7x7 inch packet. Take your rolling pin and roll the butter out, making sure to fill the corners of the packet, ensuring you get a perfectly even square of butter. Place the butter packet in the refrigerator and chill for 15 minutes, and no more. You don't want the butter to be completely solidified, otherwise it might become too brittle.Take the dough out of the fridge and roll it into a 10x10 inch square. Take the butter out and place it in the middle of the dough square, with the corners of the butter pointing toward the edges of the dough. Take the dough corners and fold them over the butter, pinching the seams shut, completely encasing the butter in the dough. Roll your laminated dough out until it is three times the original length. Fold the dough in thirds, like a letter, then rotate 90 degrees so the edges are on the left and right, and the openings are at the top and bottom. Roll the dough out again until three times the length (making sure to always roll in the direction of the openings, i.e. if the openings are at the top and bottom, roll the dough so it gets taller, not wider). Fold into thirds again. You have now completed two turns.After every two turns you'll need to wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes to prevent the butter from melting. You'll need to do four more turns for a total of six turns (729 layers!). More specifically, after your first two turns, give the dough a 30 minute chill, do two more turns, another 30 minute chill, then two final turns.After your final turn, wrap the dough tightly in plastic and refrigerate for a minimum of 2 hours, or preferably overnight before using in your favorite puff pastry recipe.",puff_pastry

Light Rough Puff Pastry
Makes about 11/2 pounds (18 ounces / 525 grams)
While the method for blending the dough might seem familiar, it is different from making biscuits, or say piecrust, where you usually want pea-sized pieces. When making puff pastry, you want large chunks of butter that will leave streaks in the dough as you roll it out. The butter should be just pliable enough to rub into the flour (5 to 10 minutes at room temperature should do the trick). And as for rolling it out, you want to roll in ONE DIRECTION ONLY. I know, did I really need to use all caps? YES. Rolling in one direction, as opposed to a back and forth motion, ensures the dough will puff properly when baking. Your choice for the direction—left to right, right to left, upwards (bless you if you have that much counter space!), whichever is most comfortable for you. This batch of puff pastry is enough for me to make one 8-inch galette des rois, and cut out a few smaller circles for a later use (personal pot pie toppings, quick hand pies). I flash freeze them on a wax paper-lined baking sheet, then store in a tightly sealed bag in the freezer.
250 grams (1 2/3 cups) all-purpose flour
6 grams (1 teaspoon) fine sea salt
125 grams (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature (cut into pieces)
150 grams (2/3 cup) cold water
Add the flour and salt to a deep bowl. Whisk to blend.
Scatter the butter over the flour. Using your fingers, rub the butter into the flour until it forms a crumbly mixture with a lot of large chunks.
Pour in the water. Using a wooden spoon, stir together until it forms a rough-looking dough. Cover the bowl with a piece of plastic wrap, and let sit in the fridge for 20 to 30 minutes.
Lightly dust a counter or large cutting board with flour. Scrape the dough out, onto the surface. Gently knead it into a rectangle. Sprinkle more flour on the board, and on top of the dough, if it seems too sticky.
Moving the rolling pin in one direction only (see headnote), roll it out until it’s 3 times the length from when you started. Fold the outer 1/3 of the dough down towards the center. Fold the other edge over, so it overlaps, creating 3 layers (see photos).
Turn the dough 1/4 (visualize the hands of a clock moving in 15-minute increments). Roll out the dough to 3 times its length again. Repeat the same folding technique, so the dough is folded into thirds. Wrap in plastic film, and set in the fridge for 20 to 30 minutes. The dough is ready to use after this final chill time. If you’re making this in advance, let the dough sit at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes, just until it’s pliable enough to roll out.

If someone asked you what your favorite sweet bakery treat would be, I would bet most of you would give an answer that includes some sort of puff pastry as it’s base. Croissants, danishes, and certainly the recently popular Cronut®.
 


 
Laminated dough is what many pastries use to get that lovely puff texture. It is accomplished by tons (hundreds!) of beautiful layers of alternating dough and butter. You have to keep everything very cold and apart. Like angry kids, or something. Keep them close enough but far enough away to function well. That’s the extend of my parenting advice… from having 2 cats.
 
Getting a dough-butter-dough base is easy enough. A large square of chilled butter– fold over some dough (détrempe), seal it, roll it out and you’re off to a good start! Now… You have to roll it out, fold it, chill it and repeat that entire process several times depending on how many layers you want to have. After all, a proper Danish pastry would have 27 layers if you are a purist. Julia would tell you that you need a whopping 730 layers for a pâte feuilletée fine, a proper fine puff pastry dough.
 

 
You may be asking yours– “Why is this guy trying to make this stuff when it is available in the friendly frozen freezer aisle at my local Kroger for $3.99?!”. It’s all about the challenge with this. That challenge becomes fun when you finally get a successful batch. The resulting dough can be used for so many delicious treats. I’ve used this dough for savory pot pies, sweet fruit pastries and most recently a danish that could be my favorite puff application ever!

If you are trying this out for the first (or second… my case third) time, be sure to keep a spare box or two of the frozen stuff in the freezer for when you are throwing the glob-of-a-mess balls of failed puff dough across the house so you can finish off your confections and have something to comfort yourself with over your pastry-making woes.

Let it stand for about 5 minutes. If the yeast is good, the mixture will get all foamy as the yeast dissolves. It could take a bit longer but if your yeast does not dissolve, see recipe notes.Make the dough: Add the flour and salt to the bowl. Using the dough hook, mix on low speed for about 5 minutes until the dough is smooth and very soft. I used about 3 1/4 cups of flour, but if you need more because the dough is too sticky than just add more, about 1 tbsp at a time. You might want to start with 3 cups and add as needed. Remove the dough from the mixing bowl and knead for a couple more minutes on your working surface. The dough needs to be soft and slightly sticky. Place the dough back in the bowl, wrap it with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for an hour.Prepare the butter: While the dough is chilling, prepare the butter. Arrange the sticks of butter horizontally on a piece of plastic wrap. Cover the butter with another piece of plastic wrap. Pound and roll out on both sides until the butter forms a nice 8 by 5 inch rectangle. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use.&nbsp;Laminate the dough: Flour your work surface lightly then roll out the dough into a big rectangle that's about 16 by 10 inches. Place the butter directly in the center of the dough and fold the dough as you would a letter, bottom third of dough over butter, then top third down over the dough. If you have any excess flour, make sure you brush that off.Turn the dough so that the short side is nearest you and start rolling it another 16 by 10 inch rectangle. Fold in thirds like a letter again. This was the first fold. Wrap it up in plastic wrap and chill it for another hour.Repeat as above. With the short side near you, start rolling until you get another 16 by 10 inch rectangle. Fold it in thirds again, wrap and chill for another hour. Repeat this 3 more times so that it will make a total of 5 folds. After the last fold, refrigerate it over night or at least for 8 hours.Shape croissants: Cut the dough in half, freeze half if you're only going to use half of it. Roll out each piece of dough into a long rectangle, so that it's about 1/4 of an inch in thickness. I found it easier if I cut the piece into 3 pieces, so that I work with 3 squares. Using a pizza cutter, cut each square into 4 triangles.Using one triangle at a time, start rolling from the wide side, at the same time, stretching the end of the triangle. Continue rolling the croissant, and as you'll notice because you stretched into a long piece, you'll be able to roll the croissant a few times.Repeat this with remaining dough and place the croissants on an ungreased baking sheet, with about 1 to 2 inches in between them.Let the croissants sit for another hour, you'll notice they'll rise a bit, then brush them with egg wash. You can make the croissants ahead of time and refrigerate them for up to 18 hours before baking. If you're making them ahead, make sure to cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap.Bake croissants: Preheat your oven to 400 F degrees. Place the baking sheet in the oven and bake the croissants for 8 to 12 minutes at 400 F degrees then turn down the heat to 375 F degrees and bake them for another 8 to 12 minutes.

I have a confession, I love puff pastry! This buttery and flaky pastry works equally well with sweet or savory dishes. And luckily it’s not that hard to make yourself. A little time consuming, yes. But you can definitely do it and it will surely impress your guests! In between folds you can take care of laundry, read a book, organise your pantry or go for a run. You can also do some other cooking experiment or have a friend over for wine.  So roll up your sleeves and get ready to roll.
Puff Pastry
about 1¼ lb (560 grams) puff pastry
1 ¾ cups (8.75 ounces, 250 grams) all-purpose flour (extra if needed) 
14 tablespoons (7 ounces, 200 grams) unsalted butter
½ to 1 teaspoon salt, optional
½ cup (130 ml) ice water

Place all-purpose flour directly onto a flat surface, preferably a cold material such as a stone or stainless steel counter top. Cut 3.5 tablespoons (1.75 ounces, 50 grams) of the butter in smaller pieces and pinch the butter into the flour until you have a coarse crumb. Don’t over work, you should still have bits of butter in there. Make a well in the crumbly dough and poor in the ice cold water. Work together quickly and form a rough ball. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

Shape the remaining butter, 10.5 tablespoons (5.25 ounces, 150 grams) into an approximately 5 inch (about 13 cm) square block. Wrap in plastic foil and refrigerate.
Assembly
Cut a deep cross in the dough ball. Fold every corner out and roll the dough with a rolling pin to an approximately 8 inch (20 cm) square. Place the butter block diagonally on top of the dough. Fold every corner into the middle (without stretching), like folding an envelope. Pinch the seams together slightly.

1st – 2nd fold
Turn the package up side down. Dust a little flour on both sides and roll it out carefully to approximately 12 inch (about 30 cm) square. Make a three fold (like folding a letter, see diagram). Flatten the fold slightly and fold a 2nd time the other way. Cover the dough and let rest in the fridge for 30 minutes. 

3rd – 4th fold
Roll the dough to approximately a 13 inch (33 cm) square. Make one 3 fold one way and another 3 fold the other way. Let rest in the fridge for 30 minutes.
5th – 6th fold
Repeat as in 3rd – 4th fold.
Let the dough rest again for 30 minutes before using. If using it later, freeze in a well wrapped freezing bag, whole or in pieces with wax paper in between. 
tips
* keep all ingredients cold
* don’t overwork the dough
* if your kitchen is very hot you will need to rest the dough in the fridge between every fold.
* if you feel that the dough starts to get too warm, refrigerate immediately
* before baking shaped pastries let them rest for 15 minutes on a cold baking sheet before baking them in the oven, it will keep the shape better

70,http://cooklikeyourgrandmother.com/how-to-make-puff-pastry/,"This is not the post I planned on writing. This was supposed to be how to make croissants. There’s this appetizer my wife makes that calls for a one of those blue cans of pre-made crescent rolls from the refrigerated section at the grocery store. I thought for sure I could do better than that.
So I found a couple of recipes, mixed and matched the parts that sounded good, and … holy crap I made puff pastry! That’s supposed to be hard. For the past year I’ve been telling myself that “someday maybe I’ll be able to make puff pastry, everyone says it’s so hard.”
Maybe it’s hard to make it on purpose, but darned if I didn’t do it by accident. Here’s how.

Ingredients
1 cup milk
1 tablespoon butter (first amount)
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 package dry yeast (2½ teaspoons)
¼ cup warm water (105° – 115°)
2½ cups flour
1 cup butter (two sticks, second amount)
Directions
Combine the milk, first measure of butter, sugar and salt in a pan.
 
 
Bring to a boil, then remove from the heat and cool to room temperature.
 
Dissolve the yeast in the warm water and add it to the milk.
 

Combine the flour and the milk mixture in a mixing bowl.
 
Use the dough hook.

Mix on low speed until the ingredients are well incorporated. It should still be fairly sticky when it’s done.
 
Place the dough in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Set it aside in a warm place for about an hour to rise until it’s doubled in volume.
 
When the dough has risen, soften one of the remaining sticks of butter in the microwave. (Yes, there is a place for microwaves in cooking.) Add the second stick and mix. You want the butter to be soft and spreadable, but not runny.
 

When the dough has risen to twice its original size, turn it out onto a floured surface.
 
Roll the dough out into a square, slightly smaller than the length of a baking sheet. Spread the butter onto the two thirds of the dough closer to you.
 
Fold the third farthest from you, the part with no butter, back over the middle third. Then fold the near third up over the middle.
 
Here’s where I took advantage of the weather. It was about 15 degrees outside while I was working on this, so my back porch was like a walk-out freezer. I would never have done this if I had to go downstairs for the freezer.
Move the dough to a baking sheet. Place another baking sheet on top and place it in the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes. You want the butter to firm up, but the dough should still be soft enough to roll out without cracking.

Uncover the dough and roll it out just enough to soften it up.
 
Fold the ends in over the middle, turn sideways and roll out to the length of the baking sheet again.
 
Another 15-20 minutes in the freezer and do it again.
 
I did three cycles outside, with the roll-fold-roll routine in between each time. After the last round outside I rolled it out square. The recipes I’d seen for croissants said to roll it into a circle. But I know the ones in the can come out in squares, and they work just fine.

Use a pizza cutter or an extremely sharp knife to cut puff pastry. If you use a dull knife you’ll press the layers together and they’ll stick together instead of separating when you bake it.

Now that I know I can do puff pastry, I’m going to go back and do the beef Wellington again.
The next two days I’ll be showing the two ways I used this batch. I usually give some silly little hint down here, but I’m just going to come out and tell you one of them is a batch of the best croissants ever.
UPDATE: Here are the home-made croissants, and here is the dill cheese appetizer.

71,https://coquinaria.nl/en/puff-pastry/,"
On Coquinaria are several historical recipes for puff pastry. On this page is a modern version. While I was searching online I saw some recipes for puff pastry that are actually just for flaky dough. Puff pastry is a kind of flaky dough, but to make puff pastry it takes something extra. Because just folding and rolling out several times flaky dough is not enough.
Modern puff pastry is made with a lot of butter and without eggs, although the puff pastry from Lancelot de Casteau does contain eggs. The basic dough for puff pastry is made with butter, and during the first time the dough is rolled out, extra butter is added. The butter must remain visible in the dough. During the baking process the butter separates the dough into very thin layers. There are several methods to add the butter. The French method is (naturally) the most exquisite but also the most complicated. The German method is rather unwieldy, the Dutch method is more simple and handy, but of course my own method is not bad at all. The recipe below is inspired by the recipe for puff pastry by Glasse and Farley from the eighteenth and nineteenth century.
In short

French puff pastry – Make a flaky dough with 20% of the total weight of flour in butter, and let it rest for a half hour in the refrigerator. Then roll out the dough and put a large square lump of butter on it. Fold the dough over the butter and roll it out again. Fold in three and roll out once more. Fold again and let rest for a half hour.
German puff pastry – Prepare a dough with just flour and water (let it rest for a half hour), and a second dough with 20% of the total weight of flour in butter. Roll out the water dough, roll out the butter dough (on baking paper), and put that on one half of the sheet of water dough. Fold the other half of the water dough over the butter dough and seal the edges with water. Roll out the dough, fold, let rest, et cetera.
Dutch puff pastry – Make a flaky dough with 20% of the total weight of flour in butter, and let it rest for a half hour in the refrigerator. Then knead the rest of the butter in small pieces through the dough, take care that the butter pieces remain visible. Roll out, fold, let rest, et cetera.
My puff pastry – Make a flaky dough with 20% of the total weight of flour in butter, and let it rest for a half hour in the refrigerator. Roll out the dough, and cover one half with thin slices of cold butter. Fold the other half of the dough over the butter. Roll out, fold, let rest, et cetera.

My puff pastry recipe in detail

250 gr (2 cups) sifted flour
50 gr (3 Tbsp + 1 tsp) cold butter in small cubes
½ tsp salt
1⅜ dl ice cold water (137 gr)
120 to 150 gr cold butter, thinly sliced
Preparation
Put the water in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes (especially during summer!).
Sift the flour, dice the butter. I always add a little flour to the butter to prevent the lumps of butter sticking together.
Knead flour, salt and water into a dough, than add the pieces of butter and knead again. The butter must remain visible. Cover the dough and let is rest for a half hour in the refrigerator.
Sprinkle some flour on the worktop. Roll out the dough to a more or less rectangular sheet. Use a slicer or knife to cut thin slices from a stick of butter, and cover one half of the dough with them. Leave ½ to 1 inch (1 to 2 cm) free around the edges. Fold the other half over the butter slices, press the edges to seal the butter inside. Roll the dough out again, fold it and let rest, wrapped in plastic foil, in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.
Then take the dough out again and roll out once more: first in one direction, fold, then in the other direction (at 90° angle). Repeat two more times.
Puff pastry can be baked at high temperatures, as it does not contain any sugar (220 °C/430 °F or more). It takes about 20 minutes to bake puff pastry. This has consequences for the stuffing: it has to be done in that time too.
Puff pastry dough is easy to freeze, but do that as a sheet, and not as a big round ball of dough.

73,https://www.thedailymeal.com/recipes/best-puff-pastry-recipe,"To make the d&eacute;trempe, sift the flour and salt together onto a clean, cool work surface. Using your fingertips, make a well in the center of the mound of flour. Run a finger through the center of the ring of flour to make a channel in the flour. Pour in the water and using your fingertips, work the water into the first ring of flour to make a paste.
And the melted butter and, using your fingertips and then a scraper, work the butter into the paste. When rough dough has formed, shape into a square block.
Using a scraper, cut an X in the top about halfway down the block. This will cut the gluten strands and help them to relax more quickly. Wrap the dough in plastic film and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
The make the beurrage, remove the chilled butter from the refrigerator. Place it between two sheets of plastic film and, using a rolling pin, beat the butter to flatten it.&nbsp;The butter should become pliable without any lumps and should remain very cold. Form the butter into a square block.
Remove the d&eacute;trampe from the refrigerator. Checks to make sure that both the d&eacute;trempe and beurrage are as near the same consistency as possible. If not, return them both to the refrigerator until equal consistency is reached.
Using a rolling pin, roll out the d&eacute;trempe to form a square just large enough to enclose the beurrage.
Lightly flour the work surface and, from this point, when rolling and turning the dough, make sure that the surface is coated with enough flour to keep the dough from sticking. The dough must never stick to the surface or it will not form proper layers.
Place the beurrage on top of the d&eacute;trempe so that it looks like a diamond inside of a square. Fold the edges of the d&eacute;trempe over the beurrage to enclose it and then pinch the dough together to lightly seal, forming a p&acirc;ton.
Using a rolling pin, press the p&acirc;ton about four or five times along its length or until it is about 23 centimeters (9 inches) long.
	Dust the work surface with flour and roll the dough out to a piece about 56 centimeters (22 inches) long, keeping the sides even and square as you work. Roll only the length of the paton; do not roll the width.
Using a pastry brush, brush off excess flour and fold the dough into thirds. Again roll the dough to a piece about 56 centimeters (22 inches) long as above. You have rolled two turns. Using your fingertips, make two marks in the dough to indicate the two turns. Wrap the p&acirc;ton in plastic film and refrigerate 20 to 30 minutes or until very cold.
Remove the dough from the refrigerator, unwrap, and put in two additional turns as directed above. Using your fingertips, make four marks in the dough to indicate four turns.&nbsp; Again, wrap the p&acirc;ton in plastic film and refrigerate 20 to 30 minutes or until very cold.
Remove the dough from the refrigerator, unwrap, and put in two more turns as above. Then, either rewrap, refrigerate for 30 minutes, and proceed with your recipe, or wrap in freezer paper, date, and freeze until ready to use. Thaw before using.",puff_pastry

Puff pastry dough | Bake to the roots
Puff pastry dough is really not complicated to prepare – it just takes a lot of time to do. A looooong time. That’s it. You probably won’t use this recipe if you’re having friends or family over and want to do something quick – but a dough like this is something you can do a day in advance and then use for several recipes. If you need a quick solution, I definitely recommend a store-bought dough. Just make sure it’s a dough prepared with butter and not plantbased fat. The one with butter is much better ;)

1. In the bowl of a food processor add 4 cups (500g) of the flour, sugar, salt an 1/8 cup (30g) of the butter and combine. Add the cold water and continue kneading until all the ingredients are well combined (5-7 minutes). Cover with plastic wrap and store in the fridge for 20 minutes.
2. Mix the remaining butter and flour and knead quickly with your hands until all is well combined. The butter should not get too warm. Form a square block – 0.4 inches (1cm) thick and 7 inches (18cm) on the sides. Wrap in plastic wrap and store in the fridge for 20 minutes.
3. On a well-floured surface spread the dough using a rolling pin from the center to edges making a square with 14 inches (35cm) on the sides. Move the dough and use flour so the dough won’t stick to the surface. Place the cooled butter block in the center of the dough square. Fold the edges of the dough to the center, so it looks like an envelope. All of the butter should be covered. Press the dough with the butter inside gently with the rolling pin so the butter block won’t break. Then roll out in one direction only, so the dough forms a rectangle with one side longer than the other side (dough should not be too thin). Fold the edges of the rectangle in thirds like a letter so it forms another rectangle with three layers. Press your thumb in the middle of the dough to mark it as the first folding round. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for 20 minutes.
4. Take the cold dough out of the fridge and place on the floured surface again. The short side should face you, so you can see the three layers. Roll the dough again in one direction only (away from you) so it forms a rectangle again. Fold the edges of the rectangle in thirds so you get your layers again. Press your thumb twice in the middle of the dough to mark the second folding round. Cover again with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for another 20 minutes. Repeat this three more times so you have five rounds of folding all in all. After the last cooling period in the fridge, the puff pastry dough is ready for use. Before you bake your goods, let them rest for another 20 minutes so you get a good and fluffy result. If you don’t let the dough rest before baking, it will shrink in the oven. Bake as directed in the recipes you’re using this dough.




1. In der Schüssel einer Küchenmaschine 500g vom Mehl, Zucker, Salz und 30g der Butter mischen. Das kalte Wasser nach und nach zugeben und zu einem glatten Teig verkneten (5-7 Minuten). In Klarsichtfolie wickeln und für 20 Minuten in den Kühlschrank legen.
2. Die restliche Butter mit dem verbliebenen Mehl kurz mit den Händen verkneten. Die Butter sollte nicht zu warm werden dabei. Einen quadratischen Block formen mit einer Dicke von ca. 1cm und 18cm Seitenlänge. In Klarsichtfolie wickeln und ebenfalls für 20 Minuten in den Kühlschrank legen.
3. Auf einer reichlich bemehlten Fläche den Teig zu einem Quadrat mit einer Seitenlänge von 35cm ausrollen. Den Teig dabei immer wieder drehen und mit Mehl bestäuben, damit er nicht festklebt. Den Butterblock aus der Folie nehmen und in der Mitte des Teiges platzieren. Die Ecken des Teigs über den Butterblock schlagen, so dass es wie ein Briefumschlag aussieht. Die Butter sollte komplett mit Teig bedeckt sein. Alles vorsichtig mit dem Teigroller zusammenpressen – die Butter sollte nicht brechen. Dann in eine Richtung ausrollen, damit ein Rechteck mit einer langen Seite entsteht (der Teig sollte nicht zu dünn sein). Von der längeren Seite her zu je einem Drittel einschlagen, damit ein kleineres Rechteck mit drei Schichten entsteht. Mit dem Daumen eine Markierung in die Oberfläche drücken um die erste Runde zu kennzeichnen. In Klarsichtfolie einschlagen und für 20 Minuten in den Kühlschrank legen.
4. Den kalten Teig aus dem Kühlschrank nehmen und auf die bemehlte Fläche legen. Die kurze Seite des Teigs sollte vor einem liegen, so dass man die Schichten des Teiges sehen kann. Erneut in nur eine Richtung ausrollen (vom Körper weg), bis wieder ein Rechteck entstanden ist. Wieder von der längeren Seite her zu je einem Drittel einschlagen um die Schichten zu bekommen. Diesmal zwei Markierungen für die zweite Runde in den Teig drücken und in Folie einschlagen und für 20 Minuten in den Kühlschrank legen. Diesen Prozess noch drei mal wiederholen, bis man 5 Runden komplett hat. Nach der letzten Kühlzeit im Kühlschrank ist der Teig fertig. Vor dem Backen die Backwaren nocheinmal 20 Minuten ruhen lassen, damit der Blätterteig leicht und luftig wird. Wenn der Teig keine Möglichkeit hat noch einmal zu ruhen, zieht er sich beim Backen zusammen. Backzeiten sind abhängig vom Rezept.

I was in the mood to make something with my hands. To create something out of nothing, not unlike a painter working on a blank canvas. I needed something to be proud of, something to show off and say “look, I made this myself, from scratch”.








Flour, water, butter. Lots of butter. Whole lots of butter. So much butter that no one person should consume on a regular basis. And yet, I needed even more. For to make puff pastry, you need to feel like butter is your friend and treat it as such. It will try to escape, to soften, to ooze out, but you need to contain it, know how and when to handle it. 








Puff pastry is the queen of doughs. It’s not a difficult one to make, not when you can be patient, when you know some tricks and tips and when you understand the idiosyncrasies of her majesty, the pâte feuilletée. 








This dough requires time—time to rest. It requires cold—cold hands, cold working area. It requires a good rolling pin and a little elbow grease. It will consume you for half a day, you need to pay attention to it, but while it is resting in the fridge, you’ll get a rest too and have the chance to tend to other things. And then, you can enjoy the glory of its hundreds of layers, the puff, the rise, the buttery goodness. 








Puff pastry is not for the faint-hearted. If you love making doughs, then you’re going to love making this one too. If not, you can certainly find ready-made puff pastry that is good, when it’s made with actual butter that is. If you’re not one to shy away from a pastry challenge, this one’s for you.








Pâte feuilletée, the French word for puff pastry which translates to layered dough, is made with flour, water and butter and it does not contain any kind of leavening agent.
It is made up of three parts: the détrempe, the beurrage and the pâton. The détrempe is a basic dough, the beurrage is a block of butter and the pâton is a package of dough formed by combining the first two parts. The beurrage is incorporated into and dispersed throughout the détrempe through a number of rolls and folds, named tours (turns), and the result is a laminated dough, a dough that has alternating layers of dough and butter pressed together. 
The layers of butter are those that make the dough rise in the oven. Butter is made of milk/fat solids and water. During baking, the water content from the butter turns to steam and pushes up the successive layers of dough, creating an airy, lightened structure. The fat from the butter is then absorbed into the layers of dough and cooks them, leading to the crisp texture and an increased stability of the light structure. The cooking of the butter’s milk/fat solids is what causes the puff pastry to take on a golden-brown color and also gives it its delicious buttery flavor.













French Puff Pastry (Pâte Feuilletée)

Below you’ll find useful tips for making puff pastry that will make your life easier. Take care to read through carefully and comprehend them before making the pastry and make sure to refer back to them while making it. The various notes throughout the recipe are terribly important as well.

• Puff pastry needs cold—cold kitchen, cold work surface, cold hands—and it’s easier and quicker to make puff pastry during the winter rather than in the summer when the temperatures are high. For example, when I make puff pastry in the winter, the dough only needs to stay in the fridge for 30 minutes between each tour but during the summer it needs at least 1 hour. 
You need to rest the dough in the fridge for two reasons. The first is for the gluten in the flour to relax, and the second for the butter to chill and set. Both make rolling out the dough easier and you also minimize the risk of tearing the layers and of the butter escaping through them. 

• The resting times in the recipe apply to winter temperatures. Adjust resting times if you’re making it during the summer or in a warm environment. Also, use your common sense. If you realize your dough is not as cold as it should be and the butter starts to ooze out or break through the layers, then return it to the fridge. 

• Don’t forget to flour your work surface and dough before rolling it out and don’t neglect brushing off the excess flour when you fold it.

• The best way to keep your hands cold while handling or rolling out the dough is by washing them under cold water.

• I always use a marble slab to roll out my puff pastry on. I don’t know if it’s a myth or not, that marble is colder than other surfaces and thus better for rolling out pastry, but I have found that it works for me. So, whatever works. (Oops, Woody alert!)

• Puff pastry doesn’t require a lot of hands-on time but because of the resting periods, you need to be available to go in and out of the kitchen at regular intervals. So arrange to make puff pastry when you know you have that time.

• Vocabulary: 
beurrage - butter block 
détrempe - basic dough 
pâton – the combined détrempe and beurrage 
tour – each rolling out and folding action 








Yield: about 1.2 kg of pastry

Ingredients

For the détrempe
500 g strong white bread flour
200 g unsalted butter, at room temperature, cut into small pieces
10 g sea salt
15 ml (1 Tbsp) lemon juice, freshly squeezed
200 ml cold tap water

For the beurrage
250 g unsalted butter, cold

Extra flour (either bread or all-purpose) for sprinkling over work surface and dough

Special equipment: stand mixer (optional yet preferable), rolling pin (it needs to be long, don’t use a short rolling pin), pastry brush, dough scraper, plastic wrap


Preparation

For the détrempe
• In a stand mixer
In the bowl of your stand mixer, add the flour, butter, salt, lemon juice and water and using the dough hook attachment, mix on medium-low speed for a couple of minutes until you have a rough dough. Do not over-knead the dough. You’re not looking to develop the gluten in the flour, we’re not making bread dough.






Empty it onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for a few seconds in order to smooth it. You should have a dough that’s pliable and that it’s not sticking to your hands; if it’s ever-so-slightly sticky though, don’t alarm yourself, it’s okay. Shape it into a ball and then press to create a 15-16 cm flattened square (see photos). Using a dough scraper, cut a cross halfway through the dough. Wrap it in plastic wrap and place it in your refrigerator for 1 hour.




• By hand
Mix the flour and salt in a large bowl and add the butter. Mix either with your hands, a pastry cutter or a fork, until the mixture resembles coarse meal and add the water and lemon juice. Mix with your hands until you have a rough dough. Empty it onto a floured surface and knead for a couple of minutes until you have a pliable and smooth dough. Don’t over-work the dough. Continue as instructed above.

For the beurrage
Take the cold butter and place it between two large pieces of plastic wrap. Using a rolling pin, beat the butter into a 15-16 cm square, the size of the détrempe. 
Place the beurrage in the refrigerator for 1 hour.




Note: The détrempe and the beurrage need to be really cold before you move on to combine them and make the pâton. They also need to be of almost equal hardness otherwise it will be difficult to incorporate the beurrage into the détrempe. 

Make the pâton
First, take the détrempe out of the fridge, unwrap it (keep the plastic wrap to re-use it) and place it on a lightly floured work surface. Dust the détrempe with flour and, using your rolling pin, roll out the four pieces of the cross you’ve made, making sure the center is not rolled out so a mound remains. See photos for reference.




Then, take the beurrage out of the fridge, unwrap it and place it in the center of the détrempe, on top of the mound, and press it gently. Now fold each rolled out piece on top of the beurrage, making sure it covers it completely and also pinching the détrempe around it so that the beurrage is encased properly in it. What you have now is the pâton.






Using your pastry brush, brush off the excess flour from the pâton, wrap it with plastic wrap (re-use the one you had wrapped the détrempe with) and place it in the fridge for 30 minutes.

Tours
From this point on what you need to do is make 6 tours; roll out and fold the dough 6 times in total. The dough needs to rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes between each tour so that the butter solidifies and doesn’t melt inside your dough thus ruining the layers you’re trying to accomplish.

Note 1: Traditionally, classic puff pastry needs to be rolled out and folded 6-8 times but 6 times is the usual.

Note 2: Before you start, keep in mind that you need to act quickly. The more the dough stays out of the fridge, the more the butter melts and the dough softens, making it difficult to roll out. I don’t want to make you panic, just be aware that you need to be quick.

1st tour
Take the pâton out of the fridge and unwrap it. Flour lightly your work surface and keep the flour at hand because you may need to dust your surface with more flour while you’re rolling out the dough. Dust the top of the pâton with flour.
The best way to roll out the pastry is by first making indentations using the rolling pin, in three-four places, the two always being towards the far edges of the pastry. (See photos for reference). This will help keep the rectangle shape of the dough but also push and distribute the butter throughout more evenly.




Then make more indentations between those first ones. It will make rolling out the pastry easier and you won’t need to put much pressure with your hands. Then roll the dough out in one direction (do not roll out the sides) into an elongated rectangle with a thickness of 1 cm (approximately 45 cm long and 20-22 cm wide). Remember to flour as you roll when you feel the dough is sticking to your work surface, otherwise the butter will peep out of the dough and your layers will be ruined. Also, if butter does leak out of the dough, then put it back in the fridge.
Furthermore, while rolling the dough out, always try to maintain a rectangle and an even shape.




Dust the flour off the dough and you now need to fold the rectangle into thirds. Divide visually the dough into thirds and fold one third over the middle, dust the flour off and then fold the opposite third over, much like you would fold a business letter. Brush off the excess flour, making sure to also brush off the flour from the bottom of the dough, and wrap it in the plastic wrap. Place the dough in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.




Note 1: Make sure you dust off the dough every time you fold it, otherwise it will dry out.

Note 2: Between tours, before rolling out the dough, you need to always scrape the butter and flour off your work surface otherwise the dough will stick to it. Have your scraper always at hand.

Note 3: If you are making puff pastry during the winter and you realize that after one tour your dough is still cold and firm enough, you can do two tours back to back before you return the dough to the fridge. However, do not get carried away and try to do more than two tours at one time, because your dough will most probably tear, you’ll lose your layers and all your hard work will go to waste.

Note 4: If you want to keep track of how many tours you have done, the classic way when making pâte feuilletée, is by marking the corner of the dough by pressing with the tip of your finger(s), making as many indentations as tours you have completed (see photo). Don’t press too hard though, you don’t want to tear the layers.




2nd tour
Take the dough out of the fridge and unwrap it. Flour lightly your work surface and place the dough, seam-side up, with its spine on your left (if you were to unfold the dough, it should open to your left, like how you open a book) and dust the top with flour. Make indentations on the dough just like you did on the previous step and then roll it out again to a 1 cm thick elongated rectangle (just like you did on the previous step). Continue rolling and folding the dough just like in the 1st tour to complete the 2nd tour.






3rd – 6th tour
From this point on, you need to repeat the same exact process 4 more times, completing 6 tours in total.

This recipe yields about 1.2 kg of puff pastry, which is a lot, so you can cut it at this point into 2 or 4 pieces, cover them with plastic wrap and keep them in the fridge.

If you want to use the pastry right away, you need to put it in the fridge for 30 minutes after the 6th tour and then roll it out again, but this time more thinly, depending on what you are making. For example, if you want to make a tart, you should roll it out 0.3-0.4 cm thick. 

You can keep the puff pastry in the fridge for 4-5 days but I find that you get a better result i.e. a higher puff, when you use it within the first couple of days. 
You can also store it in the freezer, wrapped well with plastic wrap, for one month.

You can use your puff pastry to make anything from savory and sweet pies, mille-feuilles, napoleons, tarte tatin, palmiers, beef Wellington or anything “en croute”, vol-au-vents, etc. The possibilities are endless. I'll share some recipes very soon!

Have fun making it and enjoy eating it!

Thanks to October’s Daring Bakers Challenge I was finally able to task myself to make some homemade Puff Pastry. I’ve been wanting to do it for so long now, but never really felt inspired to commit myself to the tedious affair that is laminated dough… But I am SO happy that I finally have! Because now I know that it really isn’t that tedious. I mean, it’s not like throwing together a batch of cookies by any means, but I’ve definitely made more difficult things. I’ve learned that the active time for making puff pastry is not very much. It’s mostly all about having the patience to wait around to fold and roll out the dough between multiple long, chilling periods.
If you are not familiar with puff pastry, I think it is really important that I fill you in on how it works. You know, scientifically and all.
Puff pastry is similar to croissant and danish dough in that they are referred to as laminated (layered) dough. The difference being that puff pastry dough isn’t yeasted. It relies solely on the steam from the butter upon melting to create the flakiness between layers. These layers are created by encasing butter in dough, then rolling it out and folding it over and over again to create hundreds of layers in the final product. I’ll explain some more as I walk you through the steps.







This particular recipe comes from Cooks Illustrated (my old faithful!). They use a very basic lean dough that uses lemon juice for what I can only imagine is to tenderize the dough… kind of like vinegar in a pie crust? That’s my guess at least. Some puff pastry recipes have you cut in some butter too- this recipe doesn’t. The dough comes together easily in a food processor. First you process to evenly disburse the dry ingredients, then with the food processor running you add the lemon juice and 3/4 cup water. You use the remaining 1/4 cup of water as needed to produce a dough that has no floury bits remaining.







I didn’t want to over-process my dough, so as soon as I used the full cup I pretty much stopped the food processor. I was left with some serious dry spots and some overly gummy, wet spots. I probably should have let it run until it was even but I didn’t realize it until I started to shape the dough and by then it was too late. But the good news is that between all the folding and rolling with the butter later on, all the dry pieces eventually went away. Anyways, I would just recommend that you watch out and make sure your dough is homogenous. I am sure you could also use a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment instead of the food processor. I think I’ll do that next time. I never have any luck with food processor’s distributing liquid evenly (particularly with pie crusts).
Once the dough is made, dump it out onto a dry surface, shape into a 6″ square, cover in plastic wrap, and let chill for 1 hour.







 Meanwhile, make the butter block. The butter block plays a very important role in puff pastry and has many guidelines to follow when constructing. The butter must be chilled when you make the butter block. You want the butter block to always remain chilled so that it doesn’t melt into the layers during the rolling process and become part of the dough. It must also be flexible so it will effortlessly expand into a longer and thinner layer when rolled, rather than breaking into pieces. That is why the chilling time between folds and rolls is so important, it helps you maintain the proper temperature and consistency for the butter.







There are 2 techniques to making a butter block. The one called for in this recipe has you beat the butter between two pieces of parchment with flour sprinkled on it, until it is fully incorporated. OR you can choose the much easier method of using a stand mixer. Cut the cold butter into pieces, toss it with flour in the bowl of a stand mixer, and beat it with the paddle for 1 to 2 minutes, just until smooth and blended. You can then shape out the 8″ square on some plastic wrap, cover it, and refrigerate for one hour.
Why add flour to the butter? Well, the flour absorbs any water that may leak out of the butter during lamination. (Butter is not 100% fat, it contains a small amount of water.)







Here is where things are going to start to coast along for us.
Once the dough and butter block are chilled, you roll the dough out into an 11″ square. Then you place the chilled butter block diagonally in the center of the dough.







Fold corners of dough up to meet in the center. Make sure you pinch the dough seams well to seal!







Immediately start gently tapping the dough in an effort to roll it out into a 14″ square.
Then fold the dough into thirds like a business letter.











You then need to fold the rectangle in thirds to make a nice square little package like this.
Wrap dough in plastic wrap and chill for two hours.
This step needs to be repeated two more times, for a total of three sets of rolls and folds.
BUT! It is important during the rolling process not to roll over the edges and create a seal. You will lose the flakiness in that area.







I cut my dough in half so I could freeze some of it and use it later for something else.
But it provided a great cross-section to see all those wonderful layers! How cool is that!?
At this point you just roll it out and use it for your purposes.







I was making Napoleons so I had to make a pre-baked flat sheet of puff pastry.
Heads up- the dough shrinks back as it bakes. I didn’t realize this when I rolled my dough out, otherwise I would have made it bigger.
 
So there we have it- Puff Pastry! Not as difficult as you might have thought. Just as long as you know how puff pastry works and you have patience to wait out the chilling, it is really quite simple! I can’t wait to try other laminated doughs…. I smell some croissants coming up soon!
     5.0 from 2 reviews    Print  Puff Pastry Dough    Author: Cooks Illustrated      Serves: makes about 2 pounds     Ingredients  For the Dough: 3 cups (15 ounces) all purpose flour 1½ Tb granulated sugar 1½ tsp salt 2 tsp lemon juice 1 cup water, chilled For the Butter Square: 24 tablespoons (3 sticks) unsalted butter, chilled 2 Tb all purpose flour     Instructions  For the Dough: Process flour, sugar, and salt in food processor until combined, about 5 seconds. With food processor running, add lemon juice, followed by ¾ cup water, in slow steady stream. Add remaining ¼ cup water as needed, 1 tablespoon at a time, until dough comes together and no floury bits remain. Turn dough onto sheet of plastic wrap and flatten into 6"" square. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. For the Butter Square: Lay butter sticks side by side on sheet of parchment paper. Sprinkle flour over butter and cover with second sheet of parchment. Gently pound butter with rolling pin until butter is softened and flour is fully incorporated, then roll it into an 8"" square. Wrap butter square in plastic and refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour. Roll chilled dough into 11"" square on lightly floured counter. Place chilled butter square diagonally in center of dough. Fold corners of dough up over butter square so that corners meet in middle and pinch dough seams to seal. Using rolling pin, gently tap dough, starting from center and working outward, until square becomes larger and butter begins to soften.

Earlier this year, whenever I would hear the words “puff pastry,” I would cringe. Whenever I saw the words in a recipe I would immediately flip the page or click to another recipe. I’m not going to lie. The dough, as innocent as it was, terrified me.
…and then I finally gathered up enough courage to buy a few boxes of frozen puff pastry dough while I was grocery shopping…and there they sat in my freezer. They sat…and they sat…and they sat. At times I would think of a recipe, open up the freezer, stare at the boxes and then close the freezer door without having grabbed a box. I simply could not bring myself to allow one sheet of the dough to thaw.
After about a month, I figured enough was enough. How could I let one sheet of frozen dough scare me? I took out the dough, allowed one sheet to thaw and after 30 minutes I let my creative juices flow. After 5 minutes of prep work and 10 minutes of bake time, I pulled my Mozzarella and Basil Puff Pastry Twists out of the oven. After one bite, my husband and I were hooked. We devoured one stick after another.
I turned into a puff pastry addict. I began buying box after box of frozen puff pastry dough every time I went grocery shopping because I made it a point to always have at least two boxes in my freezer at all times. I quickly discovered that this deliciously light and flaky pastry is perfect to use when preparing both sweet and savory dishes.
When it comes to the actual dough, there are four main ingredients: flour, butter, salt and water. There is no leavener in the dough…so you’re probably wondering how the dough rises to become so light, flaky and airy. The way these four ingredients are combined results in this reaction. The dough starts off like a traditional pie crust. Cold butter is mixed into the flour and combined until the mixture begins to come together. The dough is then rolled around with butter all while being folded and turned in order for the butter to be dispersed throughout the dough. This whole process creates hundreds of thin layers that are separated by butter. When the dough is placed in the oven, the butter melts and boils which creates steam. This steam lifts the layers all while the heat is cooking the flour and hardening the air pockets. This ultimately creates the famous puff.
If you want to skip the hard work, simply stop by your local grocery store and pick up a box of frozen puff pastry dough. I find the frozen variety to make life in the kitchen simple and easy. The frozen puff pastry sheets are ready to bake so that you can skip all the dirty work. This dough always results in a perfectly golden and flaky pastry.
How To Use Puff Pastry Sheets
Tips for Thawing

Decide on the number of puff pastry sheets you will need to prepare your recipe. Remove them from the box. Wrap the unused pastry sheets in either plastic wrap or foil, place in the box and return them to the freezer.
Separate the pastry sheets, place on a plate and cover each one with plastic wrap. Allow the sheets to quick thaw at room temperature for 30 minutes. If you want to thaw the sheets in the refrigerator, place the sheets on a plate and then put them in the refrigerator. Allow them to thaw for approximately four hours. This method will allow the sheets to completely and evenly thaw.

Tips for Shaping

Work with one sheet of puff pastry dough at a time.
Unfold the puff pastry sheet onto a lightly floured surface since it has a tendency to become sticky once it thaws. If the puff pastry sheet become too soft and sticky, feel free to place it in the refrigerator for a few minutes to quickly chill it.
Roll the puff pastry dough to the required measurements, according to the recipe directions.
Cut the puff pastry dough with a very sharp utensil such as a knife, pizza wheel or pastry tool.
Seal filled pastries by either pinching the edges or using the tines of a fork.
Make an egg wash (1 egg and 1 teaspoon of water) and brush it over the dough to give the dough a deep golden color.

Tips for Baking

Always preheat the oven since it only takes 10-15 minutes for the dough to cook. The best temperature to bake the dough is usually 400 degrees F.
Place the prepared pastries on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Bake in the oven for the recommended time but check the pastries periodically because they have a tendency to become fully baked and browned in a short amount of time.

This Chocolate Almond Braided Danish is absolutely amazing! If you’re a serious chocoholic, you’re going to LOVE this buttery and super chocolaty pastry!







I hope wherever you are, it is starting to feel like fall!
Sadly, that’s not the case here in Northern California since it is still sweltering, but boy I wish it would cool down soon! I am already getting into the fall mood!
Although this danish could be eaten year-round, something about it is so cozy and warming that it evokes those fall feels inside of me. I just want to light a candle, cuddle up with a book and a chunky blanket and have a window open to let in the breeze. Realistically though, I’m barricaded in the AC on full blast, windows closed to prevent wildfire smoke from coming in and am sprawled out trying to not work up a sweat after walking the dog to the corner and back.
A girl can dream!
Anyway, let’s talk danish!
This Chocolate Almond Braided Danish is super simple to make – it only uses about 5 ingredients and the flavor is outstanding! If you’re a chocolate lover, you’re going to die and go to heaven over this one because it is pure chocolaty goodness.
To start, you’ll need some thawed puff pastry sheets. These come 2 in a package and you can use one to make one danish or both to make two danishes – whatever you prefer. This recipe will be written for both pastries to be used so halve the recipe if you only need one danish. (But believe me, you’ll probably want to bake two!)
All you’ll do is unfold the pastry and brush the center portion with a little almond paste (optional but recommended for a little extra almondy sweetness). Place an unwrapped whole chocolate bar right on top. Then with some quick knife cuts, you’ll fold and braid the pastry pieces over the chocolate bar to create a giant danish. Brush it with egg wash and bake until almost done, then sprinkle with sliced almonds and finish baking. The almonds get toasty and buttery and the chocolate is melty and gooey. It’s seriously divine!

Gooey, buttery, flaky, nutty and sweet, this Chocolate Almond Braided Danish is a must make!

Chocolate Almond Braided Danish

This Chocolate Almond Braided Danish is fantastic and perfect for any chocoholic! A flaky and buttery danish pastry filled with tons of gooey chocolate and topped with nutty almonds!

Prep Time5 minsCook Time40 minsTotal Time45 mins

Course: Breakfast, DessertCuisine: American, Dessert
Ingredients1 package (2 sheets) puff pastry thawed1/2 cup almond paste optional but helps bring out almond flavor2 (4 oz each) semi-sweet chocolate bars1 large egg lightly beaten1/2 cup sliced almonds
InstructionsPreheat oven to 375° degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone liner; set aside.On a clean, flat work surface, unroll one sheet of puff pastry (it comes in a tri-fold like a pamphlet). On the middle portion, spread 1/4 cup of the almond paste in an even layer. Top with an unwrapped chocolate bar. Cut diagonal lines into the left and right side portions of the pastry about an inch apart. Remove the corner pieces (see diagram above). Starting from the top, fold down the top flap, then begin alternating left and right braided strips until you reach the bottom, then fold down the bottom flap. Tuck any remaining pieces of puff pastry underneath the danish. Repeat with remaining ingredients to make a second danish. Place both danishes about 5"" apart on the baking sheet.Brush each danish with the lightly beaten egg. Bake for 25 minutes or until very lightly golden brown. Divide the sliced almonds evenly on top of the pastries. Return to the oven and bake for another 10-15 minutes or until pastry is golden brown, flaky, and almonds are lightly toasted. For the cleanest cuts, allow pastry to cool to room temperature before serving. Otherwise, let cool for about 20 minutes before serving as chocolate will be VERY hot.
NotesThis recipe was tested with Pepperidge Farm puff pastry and Baker's semi-sweet chocolate bar. Since chocolate is the star of this recipe, I recommend using a high quality chocolate like Baker's or Ghirardelli.

 
You’re going to love this extremely buttery, ultra gooey and deliciously melty chocolate pastry!

Have a super sweet day!
