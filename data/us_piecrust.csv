Using a pastry cutter (the one I own) or two forks, cut the butter and shortening into the mixture until it resembles coarse meal (pea-sized bits with a few larger bits of fat is OK). A pastry cutter makes this step very easy and quick. Measure 1/2 cup (120ml) of water in a cup. Add ice. Stir it around. From that, measure 1/2 cup (120ml) of water&#8211; since the ice has melted a bit. Drizzle the cold water in, 1 Tablespoon (15ml) at a time, and stir with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon after every Tablespoon (15ml) added. Do not add any more water than you need to. Stop adding water when the dough begins to form large clumps. I always use about 1/2 cup (120ml) of water and a little more in dry winter months (up to 3/4 cup). Transfer the pie dough to a floured work surface. The dough should come together easily and should not feel overly sticky. Using floured hands, fold the dough into itself until the flour is fully incorporated into the fats. Form it into a ball. Divide dough in half. Flatten each half into 1-inch thick discs using your hands. Wrap each tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours (and up to 5 days). When rolling out the chilled pie dough discs to use in your pie, always use gentle force with your rolling pin. Start from the center of the disc and work your way out in all directions, turning the dough with your hands as you go. Visible specks of butter and fat in the dough are perfectly normal and expected! Proceed with the pie per your recipe&#8217;s instructions.",pie_crust

3,https://toriavey.com/toris-kitchen/old-fashioned-all-butter-pie-crust/,"Pour cold water into a small dish with a few pieces of ice to chill. There are two ways to integrate the butter into the dry ingredients… by hand mixing or with a food processor. In my experience, both methods work equally well as long as you mix the water in by hand. Don't process the water into the dough, or you'll end up with a tough crust. BREAK UP BUTTER BY HAND: Add flour and salt to a large mixing bowl, stir with a fork to blend. Take cold butter out of the refrigerator and add it to the bowl. Use a pastry cutter to cut the cold butter into the flour, using firm pressure and pushing down repeatedly to break the butter into small pieces. Work as quickly as you comfortably can. Stop when the flour and butter mixture looks like large-curd cottage cheese. There should be a variety of sizes in the butter pieces… the largest should be about the size of a pea. Place flour and butter mixture in the freezer for 2 minutes before proceeding. MIXING DOUGH WITH FOOD PROCESSOR: Fit your processor with a blade attachment. Add flour and salt to the food processor. Take cold butter out of the refrigerator and add it to the processor. Pulse the processor in 3-second bursts to break up the butter. Stop when the flour and butter mixture looks like large-curd cottage cheese. There should be a variety of sizes in the butter pieces… the largest should be about the size of a pea. It should only take 10-12 pulses to get the right consistency; start checking consistency after 8 pulses. Make sure you don’t over-process… having a variety of sizes in the butter chunks will make a flakier dough. Mixture should hold together when squeezed in your hand. Pour mixture into a mixing bowl. Place flour and butter mixture in the freezer for 2 minutes before proceeding. Take ice water out of the refrigerator. Add water to the flour mixture one tablespoonful at a time, using a fork to lightly toss the liquid into the dough. Try not to touch the dough as you mix; you want the mixture to stay as cool as possible. You may not need all the liquid to bring the dough together, so add slowly… the dough can easily turn wet and sticky if you’re not careful. By the same token, you may need a bit more liquid. Pie dough is not an exact science; every batch of dough will be different. When the dough begins to look stringy and larger lumps begin to form, take a fistful of the dough and squeeze it in your palm. Open your palm. If the dough holds together well and is just slightly tacky, it’s ready to pull into a dough ball. If the dough easily crumbles in your hand or falls apart, it is still too dry… add a little more liquid. When dough is ready, pull it together with your hands into two balls, one slightly larger than the other. Flatten the balls into disks that are 7-8 inches across. Cover the disks tightly in plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator immediately. The dough should be refrigerated for at least 1 hour, and up to 48 hours. I prefer to make the dough a day ahead and refrigerate it overnight. You can also freeze the dough for up to 3 months. If you freeze the dough, allow it to thaw and soften a bit before rolling out. TO ROLL OUT CRUSTS: Any large, smooth surface will work, as long as it is in a cool dry area. Marble is ideal. You will need to work quickly to roll out the dough-- again, you want it to stay cool, so have any tools you need nearby and ready to go: rolling pin, flour, pastry scraper, 9” pie plate or dish, a sharp knife, and a baking sheet (as needed). Lightly flour your rolling surface. Take the larger of the two dough disks out of the refrigerator and discard the plastic wrap.  Place it in the center of your rolling surface and sprinkle the top of the disk lightly with flour. Use your rolling pin to roll out the dough. I like to roll it from the center outward, a roll in each direction, as though I’m rolling around the face of a clock (12, 3, 6, 9, 12). You want the dough to expand evenly in all directions, so that it forms a large circular shape. Use more pressure in the center of the dough, and less as you near the edges. Don’t roll past the edge of the dough. As you roll, you may notice cracks forming on the outer edges. If any large cracks develop, pause and pinch the dough together to mend them before rolling again. If the dough becomes sticky as you roll, lightly re-flour the surface of the dough before proceeding. When the dough is about halfway rolled out, use a pastry scraper to loosen the dough from the board and flip it over. Re-flour the board before positioning the dough in the center again. Continue to roll out the dough in the same way as before. You want the dough to end up about 1/8” thick, and as round as possible. As you roll it out, you should see a marbled effect to the dough where patches of butter have formed. This is a good thing—those pockets of butter are what make the crust flaky. Rolling out pie dough swiftly and efficiently takes practice. You may find that your dough is getting too soft, or the butter pieces are melting, as you roll. A little stickiness can be remedied by a sprinkle of flour, but if the dough is getting warm or the fat is melting you’ll need to re-chill the dough before proceeding.&nbsp; Use the pastry scraper to loosen the dough from the board and place it on a baking sheet. Place the baking sheet in the freezer for 1-2 minutes to re-chill the dough. Continue rolling out. When the dough is about 1/8” thick all the way around, take your pie dish or plate and center it in the middle of the dough. The dough will need to extend about 2 inches past the edge of the dish. Use a sharp knife to cut any rough edges off to form a smooth 2-inch circle around the outer edge of the pie dish. Use the pastry scraper to loosen the dough from the rolling surface. Gently fold the dough in quarters. Pick it up and place it in the pie dish, centering the point of the fold in the middle of the dish. Unfold the dough and let it gently settle into the pie dish, lifting the edges of the dough and letting gravity pull it down into the corners. Do not stretch the dough to fit the plate; let it settle naturally, or you’ll end up with a leaky bottom crust. Adjust the dough as needed to keep it as centered as possible in the dish. Alternatively, you can transfer the crust to the dish by rolling it around the rolling pin and unrolling it over the pie dish. I prefer folding it, since it’s easier for me to center in the dish that way, but either method works. When the pie dish has been lined with dough, place it in the refrigerator to chill. Take the smaller of the two dough disks out of the refrigerator and roll it out the same way as you did the first. When trimming the edges, the dough only needs to extend about 1 inch beyond the edge of the pie dish. Re-chill on the baking sheet after rolling out, if necessary. This will be your top crust. Assemble your pie by filling the lower crust with your filling...&nbsp; ...dot the filling with butter, if the recipe requires it... ...then lay the top crust gently over the top of the pie. Center the top crust as much as possible over the top of the dish. Trim the edges of both crusts so that they are a little less than 1/2 inch beyond the rim of the pie dish. Roll the lower crust over the top of the upper crust and pinch gently to form a lip or edge to the crust.&nbsp; Work your way around the pie, rolling and pinching, until the circle is completed. Finish your edges by scalloping or crimping them with a fork. I like to scallop the crust by using the forefinger of one hand to make a crease, then pinching around the crease with the thumb and forefinger of the other hand. I work my way around the inner edge of the pie first making creases, then I finish it by working around the outer edge, scalloping in the opposite direction. Chill the fully assembled pie for at least 10 minutes before baking. Make an egg or milk wash and brush on the upper crust for a nicely browned finish (optional). Milk washes can be a bit uneven, so I prefer an egg wash-- use an egg yolk whisked together with 1 tsp of water. This will give it a nice golden sheen. Cut slits in the upper crust to vent (after the wash, not before),&nbsp;and sprinkle the top of the pie with sugar, if desired. I sometimes like to sprinkle it with turbinado sugar to add a light candy-like crunch and a little sparkle. Bake pie according to recipe directions. During the baking process, I usually turn the pie 180 degrees about halfway through the cooking time to make sure the crust browns evenly (ovens can be hotter in the back than in the front-- this allows for more even heat distribution). If these instructions are followed carefully, you should end up with a flavorful, flaky pie crust! Happy baking. :)",pie_crust

Place a few ice cubes in a small measuring cup (1 cup) and fill with cold water. Stir and set aside. Mix the flour and salt. Combine the flour and salt in the bowl of a food processor and pulse a few times to combine. Alternatively, if making crust by hand, whisk the flour and salt together in a large mixing bowl.  Add half of the butter to the flour: Scatter half the cubes of butter over the surface of the flour. Attach the food processor lid and pulse 15 to 20 times until the mixture resembles cornmeal with pieces of butter no larger than a pea.

Check to see if the dough is holding together by squeezing a bit in your hand — if it holds together and feels tacky. It&#x27;s ready; if it breaks apart easily, add a little more water. Add more water a tablespoon at a time as needed. The final dough should have large clumps of dough, small pebbles of butter and should hold together when pressed.  Press the pie dough into disks and refrigerate: Turn the pie dough out onto a clean work surface. Divide the dough into two piles (about 13 ounces each). Use the palm of your hand to quickly gather and press each mound into a thick disk.

Unwrap 1 of the disks and place on a work surface dusted with flour. Sprinkle a rolling pin with flour. Working from the middle of the dough outwards, roll the dough into a around 12 to 13 inches in diameter (a few inches larger than your pie pan). Use firm strokes and work the dough as little as possible. If the dough cracks when you first start rolling, let it stand for one minute to warm slightly before rolling again. Use more flour if the dough starts to stick. Use a pastry scraper to lift the pastry from the work surface and make sure it&#x27;s not sticking. Transfer the crust to the pie pan:  Sprinkle the top of the pie crust and your rolling pin with a little flour. Lay your rolling pin on one edge of the pie crust and begin gently rolling the pie crust over the rolling pin. When it&#x27;s all rolled up, move it to the pie pan and gently unroll. Ease the pie crust into the corners of the pan. Trim all but an inch or two of the pie dough from around the edge; use the trimmings to patch up any holes or tears. Chill the rolled-out dough in the pie plate. Refrigerate the pie plate lined with dough for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the oven and prepare the filling. Preheat the oven to 425°F. Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 425°F. Prepare the filling. Prepare the filling following your recipe&#x27;s instructions. Fill the pie. Remove the pie pan with crust from the refrigerator and fill it with the prepared filling. Roll out the top crust. Remove the second disk of dough from the refrigerator.

Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 20 minutes and up to overnight. Pie Crust Without Fear: Even experienced cooks can find it intimidating to make pie pastry. The following tips will help you turn out a terrific crust with ease. Keep the dough cold and the butter chunky. For a flaky crust, keep the butter from melting into the dough before baking. Why? Those bits of butter, which should be roughly pea-size, are meant to melt in the oven, giving off steam that creates flaky pockets. If the dough seems to be softening too much as you're working with it, throw it in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. As you roll out the dough, you should see veins of butter running through it. Roll out from the center. It's much easier to roll dough into a circle if you work from the center out to the edge in all directions. Don't overdo it. Overworking the dough and using too much flour can make pie crust tough and dry. Try to keep a light hand with both, rolling just enough to reach your desired size and using only enough flour to keep the dough from sticking to the counter. Use a pie crust bag. This handy tool takes the strain out of rolling by providing a nonstick round frame for the dough as you roll it out, allowing you to use less flour and avoid shaggy edges. Simply put your chilled dough in the bag, zip it up, roll it out, and transfer it to your pan. The bags come in different sizes for regular and deep-dish pies and are available from many online sources (such as www.sugarcraft.com; $3 to $6 per bag). Use store-bought dough. If you're short on time (or patience), you can always use ready-made dough. In our tests, we preferred Pillsbury Just Unroll refrigerated pie crusts ($99), which have a nicely crisp texture (if slightly bland flavor) and Trader Joe's Gourmet Pie Crusts ($49), which have a more buttery finish. Crimp the edges. Crimping or fluting the edges of a double-crust pie seals the dough and keeps the filling from leaking out during baking. Even on a single-crust pie, crimping can create a helpful dam effect. There are many good techniques, but our favorite is to pinch the dough around the index finger of one hand using the thumb and forefinger of the other.

You want the dough to be wet but not formed itself into a ball. Remove the mixture onto the tabletop and check the texture by hand. The crumbly mixture should form clumps when you press some of it with your hand. If I think it is too dry, I sprinkle my hands with cold water and work the dough. This way I don't accidentally add too much moisture. Do not knead it too much, just enough to be able to wrap up the dough in plastic. You will see streaks and spots of butter. This is good!

The dough is ready when it holds together in a ball when squeezed in your palm. Transfer the dough to a clean work surface and bring the dough together. You don’t want to overwork the dough, but you need to work it enough that it is a cohesive disc with no real cracks or very dry bits. Wrap the dough disc in plastic wrap and chill for 30 minutes. The dough can sit in the fridge for up to 4 days, otherwise double wrap in plastic or in a zip top bag and store in the freezer for up to 3 months. Lightly flour your work surface and unwrap a disc of chilled dough. Flour the top of the dough. Using a rolling pin, push down on the dough, giving it a quarter turn every few smushes, to spread the dough evenly and ensure it doesn’t stick to the surface. Start to roll out the dough, continuing to turn. If any cracks form, smush them back together. Roll out the dough to a circle about ⅛-inch (3 mm) thick. Enjoy!",pie_crust

49,https://toriavey.com/toris-kitchen/old-fashioned-all-butter-pie-crust/,"Pour cold water into a small dish with a few pieces of ice to chill. There are two ways to integrate the butter into the dry ingredients… by hand mixing or with a food processor. In my experience, both methods work equally well as long as you mix the water in by hand. Don't process the water into the dough, or you'll end up with a tough crust. BREAK UP BUTTER BY HAND: Add flour and salt to a large mixing bowl, stir with a fork to blend. Take cold butter out of the refrigerator and add it to the bowl. Use a pastry cutter to cut the cold butter into the flour, using firm pressure and pushing down repeatedly to break the butter into small pieces. Work as quickly as you comfortably can. Stop when the flour and butter mixture looks like large-curd cottage cheese. There should be a variety of sizes in the butter pieces… the largest should be about the size of a pea. Place flour and butter mixture in the freezer for 2 minutes before proceeding. MIXING DOUGH WITH FOOD PROCESSOR: Fit your processor with a blade attachment. Add flour and salt to the food processor. Take cold butter out of the refrigerator and add it to the processor. Pulse the processor in 3-second bursts to break up the butter. Stop when the flour and butter mixture looks like large-curd cottage cheese. There should be a variety of sizes in the butter pieces… the largest should be about the size of a pea. It should only take 10-12 pulses to get the right consistency; start checking consistency after 8 pulses. Make sure you don’t over-process… having a variety of sizes in the butter chunks will make a flakier dough. Mixture should hold together when squeezed in your hand. Pour mixture into a mixing bowl. Place flour and butter mixture in the freezer for 2 minutes before proceeding. Take ice water out of the refrigerator. Add water to the flour mixture one tablespoonful at a time, using a fork to lightly toss the liquid into the dough. Try not to touch the dough as you mix; you want the mixture to stay as cool as possible. You may not need all the liquid to bring the dough together, so add slowly… the dough can easily turn wet and sticky if you’re not careful. By the same token, you may need a bit more liquid. Pie dough is not an exact science; every batch of dough will be different. When the dough begins to look stringy and larger lumps begin to form, take a fistful of the dough and squeeze it in your palm. Open your palm. If the dough holds together well and is just slightly tacky, it’s ready to pull into a dough ball. If the dough easily crumbles in your hand or falls apart, it is still too dry… add a little more liquid. When dough is ready, pull it together with your hands into two balls, one slightly larger than the other. Flatten the balls into disks that are 7-8 inches across. Cover the disks tightly in plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator immediately. The dough should be refrigerated for at least 1 hour, and up to 48 hours. I prefer to make the dough a day ahead and refrigerate it overnight. You can also freeze the dough for up to 3 months. If you freeze the dough, allow it to thaw and soften a bit before rolling out. TO ROLL OUT CRUSTS: Any large, smooth surface will work, as long as it is in a cool dry area. Marble is ideal. You will need to work quickly to roll out the dough-- again, you want it to stay cool, so have any tools you need nearby and ready to go: rolling pin, flour, pastry scraper, 9” pie plate or dish, a sharp knife, and a baking sheet (as needed). Lightly flour your rolling surface. Take the larger of the two dough disks out of the refrigerator and discard the plastic wrap.  Place it in the center of your rolling surface and sprinkle the top of the disk lightly with flour. Use your rolling pin to roll out the dough. I like to roll it from the center outward, a roll in each direction, as though I’m rolling around the face of a clock (12, 3, 6, 9, 12). You want the dough to expand evenly in all directions, so that it forms a large circular shape. Use more pressure in the center of the dough, and less as you near the edges. Don’t roll past the edge of the dough. As you roll, you may notice cracks forming on the outer edges. If any large cracks develop, pause and pinch the dough together to mend them before rolling again. If the dough becomes sticky as you roll, lightly re-flour the surface of the dough before proceeding. When the dough is about halfway rolled out, use a pastry scraper to loosen the dough from the board and flip it over. Re-flour the board before positioning the dough in the center again. Continue to roll out the dough in the same way as before. You want the dough to end up about 1/8” thick, and as round as possible. As you roll it out, you should see a marbled effect to the dough where patches of butter have formed. This is a good thing—those pockets of butter are what make the crust flaky. Rolling out pie dough swiftly and efficiently takes practice. You may find that your dough is getting too soft, or the butter pieces are melting, as you roll. A little stickiness can be remedied by a sprinkle of flour, but if the dough is getting warm or the fat is melting you’ll need to re-chill the dough before proceeding.&nbsp; Use the pastry scraper to loosen the dough from the board and place it on a baking sheet. Place the baking sheet in the freezer for 1-2 minutes to re-chill the dough. Continue rolling out. When the dough is about 1/8” thick all the way around, take your pie dish or plate and center it in the middle of the dough. The dough will need to extend about 2 inches past the edge of the dish. Use a sharp knife to cut any rough edges off to form a smooth 2-inch circle around the outer edge of the pie dish. Use the pastry scraper to loosen the dough from the rolling surface. Gently fold the dough in quarters. Pick it up and place it in the pie dish, centering the point of the fold in the middle of the dish. Unfold the dough and let it gently settle into the pie dish, lifting the edges of the dough and letting gravity pull it down into the corners. Do not stretch the dough to fit the plate; let it settle naturally, or you’ll end up with a leaky bottom crust. Adjust the dough as needed to keep it as centered as possible in the dish. Alternatively, you can transfer the crust to the dish by rolling it around the rolling pin and unrolling it over the pie dish. I prefer folding it, since it’s easier for me to center in the dish that way, but either method works. When the pie dish has been lined with dough, place it in the refrigerator to chill. Take the smaller of the two dough disks out of the refrigerator and roll it out the same way as you did the first. When trimming the edges, the dough only needs to extend about 1 inch beyond the edge of the pie dish. Re-chill on the baking sheet after rolling out, if necessary. This will be your top crust. Assemble your pie by filling the lower crust with your filling...&nbsp; ...dot the filling with butter, if the recipe requires it... ...then lay the top crust gently over the top of the pie. Center the top crust as much as possible over the top of the dish. Trim the edges of both crusts so that they are a little less than 1/2 inch beyond the rim of the pie dish. Roll the lower crust over the top of the upper crust and pinch gently to form a lip or edge to the crust.&nbsp; Work your way around the pie, rolling and pinching, until the circle is completed. Finish your edges by scalloping or crimping them with a fork. I like to scallop the crust by using the forefinger of one hand to make a crease, then pinching around the crease with the thumb and forefinger of the other hand. I work my way around the inner edge of the pie first making creases, then I finish it by working around the outer edge, scalloping in the opposite direction. Chill the fully assembled pie for at least 10 minutes before baking. Make an egg or milk wash and brush on the upper crust for a nicely browned finish (optional). Milk washes can be a bit uneven, so I prefer an egg wash-- use an egg yolk whisked together with 1 tsp of water. This will give it a nice golden sheen. Cut slits in the upper crust to vent (after the wash, not before),&nbsp;and sprinkle the top of the pie with sugar, if desired. I sometimes like to sprinkle it with turbinado sugar to add a light candy-like crunch and a little sparkle. Bake pie according to recipe directions. During the baking process, I usually turn the pie 180 degrees about halfway through the cooking time to make sure the crust browns evenly (ovens can be hotter in the back than in the front-- this allows for more even heat distribution). If these instructions are followed carefully, you should end up with a flavorful, flaky pie crust! Happy baking. :)",pie_crust

Everything you ever needed to know about making pie crust. Which dough to use (mealy or flaky), for single crust, double crust, and no-bake pies 







So often when I read about the “perfect pie crust recipe” the recipe only includes one type of pie crust. This confused me because when I was learning how to make pies in pastry school, we learned to make two types of pie crust. The mealy dough which was very similar to a shortbread crust for pies that were very liquidy and flaky pie dough for cream pies or double-crust pies. Each crust plays an important part and it’s important to know which one to use and why to avoid pie fails like shrinking, cracking and soggy bottom crusts. So if you’re having any of these problems, keep reading and learn how to make the perfect pie every time. For real!What is mealy dough?Mealy dough is made from flour, salt, butter egg and water. The dry ingredients are blended together with the butter to form a mealy texture before adding in the water to bind it all together. The butter pieces are very small which creates a dough that is very good at repelling moisture from liquid fillings like pumpkin or un-cooked fruit fillings.The mealy dough is most often used for the base of double-crust pies or for custard-based pies. 







What is flaky pie dough?Flaky pie dough is made with flour, salt, butter, and water. The butter is left in larger chunks so that when the crust is baked, you get more flaky layers than you would from baking mealy pie dough. Flaky pie dough is incredibly tender and melts in your mouth when you bite into it but is not very good at repelling water because the butter pieces are so large. The liquid can easily seep through the dough, causing soggy, undercooked bottoms. Flaky pie dough is best used for the top crust of double-crust pies or for no-bake cream pies. For no-bake cream pies, you will have to blind-bake the crust first, let it cool then fill it. 







How do you make pie dough?Whether you are making mealy dough or flaky dough, it’s important to keep the butter cold. I grate my cold butter right into the flour so the butter stays cold. Remember, don’t over-mix the pie dough. Over-mixing will cause the gluten to get really tough and your dough will not be as tender. It’s better to have a few cracks when you are rolling out then to over-work your dough for the sake of it looking pretty. 







Once you have the butter incorporated, add the water in small amounts and gently mix with your hand to distribute the water. Once it’s barely sticking together, stop. Press the mixture together, wrap in plastic wrap and let the dough chill for at least one hour or overnight. This gives the flour time to absorb the water without activating more gluten. Resting also allows the gluten that has activated to relax so that your dough is easier to roll out and it won’t spring back. Tip: Flatten your dough into a disk instead of leaving it in a ball so that it is easier to roll out later. 







Once your dough has rested, let it warm up a bit at room temperature. It should be warm enough that when you press down on it with the rolling pin you can make an impressing but firm enough that the butter isn’t melted and soft. Work quickly to roll out your dough. If your dough is sticking, add more flour to your rolling pin or roll between parchment paper. Dough should be rolled out to 1/8″-1/4″ thick. 







How do you prevent pie dough from shrinking?After you have the dough rolled out, transfer it to your pie plate. You can use glass, ceramic or metal. I like metal pie plates because they really brown the bottom of the crust well but glass plates are also really great so you can see if the bottom crust is done baking.Whatever plate you use, a little shrinking is normal. In fact, that’s how you know when your pie is done baking. When the crust shrinks away from the sides. If it hasn’t pulled away from the sides, no matter how brown and beautiful it is on top, the bottom is still under-cooked and will be soggy.







How do you prevent the crust from shrinking too much? Leave 1/4″ of extra dough around the entire pie plate when you trim off the excess to account for shrinking.Do not over-work the dough. Over-working causes the gluten to activate and contract when baking which causes shrinking. Freeze your pie dough for 20 minutes before filling or blind-baking.







How do you blind bake pie dough? Blind baking is when you bake your pie dough before you fill it. The reason for blind-baking is for when you’re making a pie that doesn’t require the interior to be baked like when you’re making cream pies (like chocolate or coconut), pre-cooked custard pies (like banana cream or haupia) or frozen pies. The biggest challenge when blind baking pie dough is keeping the sides from collapsing down the sides. These are the steps to blind baking a pie successfully. 







Leave a little extra dough around the perimeter of the pie plate when you trim to account for shrinking.Poke the bottom of your pie crust with a fork (also called docking) to prevent the steam from making your crust bubble up. Freeze your pie dough for at least 20 minutes to prevent sliding. Line your pie plate with a piece of parchment paper or aluminum foil and fill to the top with pie weights or dried beans. Place the pie plate on the bottom rack of the preheated oven. Bake for 15 minutes at 375ºFRemove the foil and parchment, brush with egg wash then continue baking uncovered for 15 minutes or until golden brown and the sides of the crust shrink away from the pie plate. How do you make a double-crust pie?To make a double-crust pie, fill your pie pan with mealy pie dough as usual and then chill while you prepare your flaky pie dough. Roll out your flaky pie dough and cut into 1″ strips if desired for a lattice crust. Brush the mealy dough with egg wash (1 egg or egg white mixed with 1 Tablespoon of water and whisked). 







Arrange your lattice or place your second layer of dough on top of the mealy dough and trim off the excess dough. Press the two doughs together and flute the sides or press with a fork. If using a single sheet of pie dough, make sure you cut in some vents to allow air to escape. Brush the surface with more egg wash and some sanding sugar if desired for texture, color, and flavor before baking. 







How do you prevent the pie crust from getting too brown?If your pie crust has not shrunk from the sides of the plate and is getting too brown, you can cover the top of the crust with some aluminum foil or you can move one of your oven racks to the top of the oven and put a sheet pan or piece of aluminum foil on the rack to prevent browning. I prefer to do it this way so that I don’t accidentally damage my pie. You can also purchase pie crust protectors that sit on top of the pie crust as it bakes to prevent browning. So hopefully this has answered a lot of your questions on how to make the perfect pie crust.

Cut slits in the center and gently place the dough over your filled pie. Crimp the edges as desired and baked as directed for the recipe.NotesIf you do not want to use vodka in your pie crust, simply replace it with more water. Keep in mind the vodka adds to the flaky texture of the crust and the alcohol will cook out during baking.Make ahead tipPrepare the pie dough through step 2 and freeze the discs for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight before using.Recommended ProductsAs an Amazon Associate and member of other affiliate programs, I earn from qualifying purchases.

From A Reader:
I purchase frozen pies most of the time. My husband prefers peach. To make them “more like Mama’s” when they come out of the oven, I sprinkle the tops of the pies with a few sprinkles of granulated sugar & a few sprinkles of cinnamon. I always have multiple compliments on my “homemade pies”.
I love your newsletter!!
Sincerely, 
 Terri H., Pahrump, NV
Thanks for the great tip Terri. You can add the sugar before you bake it too. Try carving your last name initial in the top crust before you bake it with a knife. You would really have them fooled then. : )

Use a pastry blender or fork to combine the mixture until it forms pea-sized bits and looks like wet sand. Add the ice water and use a fork to continue mixing until a shaggy dough forms. Use your hands to form the dough into two, flattened discs. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1-2 hours, minimum before using or freeze up to 4 weeks.",pie_crust
66,https://boulderlocavore.com/all-butter-pie-crust/,"Cut the butter into ½-inch cubes. Place in the freezer*. TIP: I cut the sticks into tablespoons then quarter each tablespoon. In the bowl of a standing mixer equipped with the paddle attachment, combine the 3 cups flour, 1 teaspoon salt and 2 teaspoons sugar. Run the mixer paddle on low a few times just to combine them. With the mixer running on low speed, add a few pieces of the chilled butter at a time until it is all in the mixing bowl and coated with flour. NOTE: It will not have broken down completely; it will be mashed. With the mixer running on slow speed, slowly pour in the ice water until the mixture forms a dough. It will begin to ball up around the mixer paddle. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and form a tight ball. Flatten the ball slightly (this will make it easier to roll out and being in a circle shape helps the shape stay round when rolling the crust out) and tightly wrap with two layers of plastic wrap. Place in the freezer for 45-60 minutes*. After the 45 to 60 minutes remove the dough from the freezer and let it rest on the counter for about 15 minutes or until it becomes workable. NOTE: It should still be very firm when you start to roll it. Do not allow the dough to warm up too much or you’ll encounter the same butter seepage concerns. To roll the dough out: Divide the dough ball. Roll out one half on a lightly floured surface. Lightly flour the rolling pin too if needed to prevent sticking. Pie crust should be ¼-inch thick.",pie_crust
67,https://www.favfamilyrecipes.com/how-to-make-the-perfect-pie-crust/,"Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Cut in shortening with pastry cutter or hands until crumbs form (see picture above for consistency). Slowly add 1/4 cup water and mix until just combined. Careful not to handle too much after adding the water. You want it to just be able to hold together. Do not knead or over mix. This is the secret to getting flaky pie crust! Roll out dough on a floured surface and place in pie pan, pressing down to form to the pan. Using a fork, poke holes all around the pie crust to keep from bubbling up. Bake on bottom shelf of the oven for 10-12 minutes (or 50-60 minutes for a two-crust pie).",pie_crust
68,https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/perfect-pie-crust-recipe/,"Before you make the crust, cut the butter for the crust into small cubes and set on a plate. Place in the freezer for 15-30 minutes so it gets VERY COLD. While you do this, you can get all of your other ingredients out and ready to go. To make the crust: Add the flour, sugar and salt to a food processor and pulse a few times to combine. Add the VERY COLD butter cubes and pulse again for 20-30 seconds until pie dough starts to resemble tiny peas. Next, add 1 tablespoon of vodka, then add in 2-3 tablespoons ICE COLD water to the dough. Pulse until dough comes together just a bit, resembling small beads. The dough should still be somewhat crumbly; I recommend squeezing a small amount of dough between your fingers; it should stick together well, but if it doesn’t and is very crumbly, add more ice water, 1/2 tablespoon at a time, until it just comes together. If your dough is too wet, add flour 1/2 tablespoon until it comes together. I usually don’t mess with ratios too much because this is what works for me. Do not overwork the dough. Place dough onto a well-floured surface and form into a disk shape, then wrap with plastic wrap or in a reusable bag. Chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 days. Dough can also be frozen for up to 2-3 months if well wrapped in both plastic and then foil. Once dough has been chilled for at least 30 minutes, place dough on a VERY well-floured clean surface and use a floured-rolling pin to roll the dough into a round shape about 1 1/2 inches larger than an upside-down 9-inch pie plate. Fold dough in half to help transfer to place in pie plate. Unfold and ease the dough into the pan. (If you mess up, that’s completely okay — just reshape the dough into a disk and roll out again.) Trim the extra crust around the edges of the pie plate and discard excess dough. Flute the edges of the crust however you’d like (I normally use my finger and thumb to pinch the dough or you can use a fork!). Cover the pie crust tightly with plastic wrap and place pie pan in the refrigerator while you prepare your pie filling. Makes 1 pie crust.

(I really am smiling right now by the way)A good pie must first start with a good pie crust! Most homemade, from scratch pie crust recipes I’ve tried are pretty bland, which probably isn’t the recipes fault. Pie crusts are usually boring in order not to compete with the pie itself. Understable. Not agreeing but understandable.However, I’m a sucker for a scratch- made pie crust that is buttery tasting (yes pie crust should always be made with REAL butter in my book!), tender and just makes you wanna keep pinching lil pieces of crust off the edge to eat. You know what I’m talking about? Oh Oh Oh and it also has to be EASY and fool proof because it is no secret that I suck am still learning how to make breads and thangs from scratch.I honestly can’t tell you when was the last time I’ve purchased a store-bought pie crust.  Now that I know how to make an incredible homemade pie crust I’ve actually gotten a little uppity when it comes to store-bought crust. I don’t like there odd color or the smell of it’s fake, processed ingredients. Butter, sugar, flour and salt. Yes that’s what makes a REAL pie crust. Oh wait…this recipe has butter Crisco in it…um…. Ok so ONE questionable ingredient doesn’t count! (p.s I will still nail a store bought pie crust because I’m greedy, but that doesn’t mean I would buy it myself!)I call this recipe The Best Homemade Pie Crust  because well… I have yet to taste a homemade crust with this much flavor yet still remains subtle.

71,https://bakedbree.com/how-to-make-pie-crust,"I put the bowl of the food processor in the freezer with the flour, sugar, and salt for a bit before I am ready to get working. Give it a quick pulse to combine. Add the frozen butter and shortening to the bowl. Pulse until the butter and flour mixture resemble a coarse meal. Dorie says that you are aiming for some pieces to look like peas and others to look like barley. Slowly, add a Tablespoon at a time of the ice cold water. The goal is to have it wet enough that it will stick together when pinched, but not too much water that it will be sticky. Pulse the food processor until the dough just comes together. I think that this step is the hardest in the entire dough making process. I added a little too much water. (It is hard to take pictures of pouring water sometimes and concentrate on the perfect amount for my pie crust) It ended up being just fine after it was chilled, but I would add a Tablespoon at a time until the consistency is just right. Do as I say, not as I do. Turn the dough out give it a quick knead until it comes together. If you are making a double crust, cut the dough in half. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and put in the fridge for an hour. It really needs to be cold. So you sense a theme here? Cold. Very, very cold. You can freeze the dough at this point or keep in the fridge for a day or two. When you are ready to roll out the dough, make sure that you have everything ready. Your rolling pin, flour, and pie plate. Roll out the dough to the desired thickness. As you can see, I have not perfected getting a perfect circle. They sell those mats that help you roll it out into the right shape and diameter. I should get one of those. I use my pie plate as my guide. I roll my crust up onto my rolling pin and then unroll it over my pie plate. I use a pair of kitchen shears to trim the overhang. I tuck the edges underneath back into the pie plate. Then using two fingers I press down to crimp the edges. Beautiful. I put the pie crust back into the freezer until I am ready to bake it. When you are ready to bake the shell, (I am blind baking this pie crust, but if you were going to make a fruit pie or something, then you would bake it all at the same time) preheat your oven to 400 degrees. Take a fork and pierce the pie crust a few times to let air escape. Cover the pie with parchment paper and fill with pie weights. I use dried beans. I keep a few jars of these beans in my pantry and they are only used for this purpose. You cannot eat these after you have baked them. You can use tin foil instead of parchment if you like. Put the pie crust on a baking sheet and bake for 25 minutes. Carefully remove the parchment paper and pie weights. If the crust has puffed up press it down with the back of a spoon. For a partially baked crust, return the pie to the oven for another 8 minutes. To fully bake the crust, bake it for another 10 minutes. If your outer crust is getting a little dark, make a tin foil cuff to go around the outside, it will still cook without coloring. Let the pie cool before you fill it.",pie_crust
72,https://whatscookingamerica.net/piecrst.htm,"In a large bowl with a pastry blender or two knives, cut vegetable shortening into flour and salt until particles are the size of small peas. &nbsp;Sprinkle in water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until all flour is moistened and pastry dough almost cleans side of bowl (1 to 2 teaspoons additional water can be added if necessary). &nbsp;You want the ingredients to barely bind together. Pie dough benefits from a rest period after mixing. &nbsp;This will make the dough easier to roll and shape. &nbsp;Once the dough has come together, form it into a disc (approximately 1/2 inch thick) and wrap it tightly in plastic wrap. &nbsp;Place the prepared dough in the refrigerator during this resting time. &nbsp;As long as the dough is kept in the refrigerator, you can keep it there for as long as 24 hours. &nbsp;When ready to use, let the dough sit at room temperature approximately 20 to 30 minutes before rolling. Flour your hands generously. &nbsp;Tilt the rolling pin and sprinkle it with flour as you rotate the rolling pin. &nbsp;On a lightly floured surface, form pastry into a ball; shape into a flattened round. &nbsp;(For two-crust pie, divide pastry into halves and shape into two rounds.) &nbsp; Roll pastry 2 inches larger than an inverted pie plate with a floured rolling pin. &nbsp;Try to control the rolling pin and move from the center out. &nbsp;Do not use the rolling pin to go back and forth. &nbsp;Use your rolling pin something like this: Roll North, pick up the pin, roll Northeast, pick up dough and move counter-clockwise, repeat. &nbsp;You want the crust as evenly rolled as you can. &nbsp; Fold pastry into quarter folds and ease into pie plate, pressing firmly against bottom and sides of pie plate. &nbsp;",pie_crust
73,https://tarateaspoon.com/perfect-pie-crust-plus-5-expert-crust-tips/,"In a food processor, pulse together the flour, salt and sugar. Add the shortening and half the butter. Pulse 8 to 10 times or until mixture is coarse crumbs and some of the butter is pea-size. (Alternatively, combine in a bowl using a pastry blender or a fork.) In a measuring cup, combine vinegar with ½ cup of the very cold water. Add the remaining butter to the food processor, and while pulsing processor, drizzle in just enough water mixture to form dough, 5 to 8 tbsp. (Dough may be slightly dry but will hold together when you pinch it.) Add water as needed to create a dough that holds together when pinched. Transfer dough to a sheet of plastic wrap and use the wrap to bring the dough together in one ball. Halve dough, wrap each half in plastic wrap and press into disks. Chill 1 hr or until ready to use. May be kept refrigerated for 3 to 4 days or frozen for up to 4 months. To pre-bake crust, roll into a 12- to 13-inch circle and gently transfer to pie plate. Trim edges (or decorate as desired) and chill or freeze until very cold. Line cold crust with a double thickness of foil or line with parchment. Fill with pie weights or dry beans and bake at 375ºF until edges are just golden, 12 min. Remove foil or parchment and weights; bake another 10 to 12 min until cooked through. Let cool before filling. Follow instructions in individual pie recipes for other preparations.",pie_crust
