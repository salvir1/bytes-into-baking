    "## Searching for croissant baking temperatures\n",
    "- Searches for 'croissant bake temperature' or 'temperature cuisson croissant' were conducted on Google country-specific search sites for the US, UK, and France. The first 100 links were obtained for each country. These links were subsequently scraped to determine if they were a croissant baking recipe, and if so, for their initial baking temperature.\n",
    "- Baking temperatures were found by looking for sentences that contained the words 'preheat', 'bake', or 'oven' followed by a 3 digit number followed by a temperature indicator. \n",
    "- Croissant baking often employs a two-stage approach with a high starting temp followed by a lower finishing temp. The script pulled the first temperature mention, so this is the starting temp.\n",
    "- For the US graphic, websites were excluded if the first temperature mention was in celsius.\n",
    "- For the UK and French graphics, websites were excluded if the first temperature mention was in fahrenheit.\n"

      "Watch the video above and use the step-by-step photos before you begin. Read the recipe before beginning. Make room in the refrigerator for a baking sheet. In step 6 and again in step 13, you will need room for 2 baking sheets.\n",
      "Cut the butter in four 1-Tablespoon pieces and place in the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment (or you can use a handheld mixer or no mixer, but a stand mixer is ideal). Add the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast. Turn the mixer on low-medium speed to gently combine the ingredients for 1 minute. With the mixer running, slowly pour in the milk. Once all of the milk is added, turn the mixer up to medium-high speed and beat the dough for at least 5 full minutes. (If you don’t have a mixer, knead by hand for 5 minutes.) The dough will be soft. It will (mostly) pull away from the sides of the bowl and if you poke it with your finger, it will bounce back. If after 5 minutes the dough is too sticky, keep the mixer running until it pulls away from the sides of the bowl.\n",
      "Remove dough from the bowl and, with floured hands, work it into a ball. Place the dough on a lightly floured silicone baking mat lined, lightly floured parchment paper lined, or lightly floured baking sheet. (I highly recommend a silicone baking mat because you can roll the dough out in the next step directly on top and it won’t slide all over the counter.) Gently flatten the dough out, as I do in the video above, and cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and allow the covered dough to rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.\n",
      "Remove the dough from the refrigerator. I like to keep the dough on the silicone baking mat when I’m rolling it in this step because the mat is nonstick and it’s a handy guide for the exact measurement. Begin flattening out the dough with your hands. You’re rolling it out into a rectangle in this step, so shaping it with your hands first helps the stretchy dough. Roll it into a 14&#215;10-inch rectangle. The dough isn&#8217;t extremely cold after only 30 minutes in the refrigerator, so it will feel more like soft play-doh. Be precise with the measurement. The dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working the edges with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct size rectangle.\n",
      "Place the rolled out dough back onto the baking sheet (this is why I prefer a silicone baking mat or parchment because you can easily transfer the dough). Cover the rolled out dough with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and allow the covered dough to rest in the refrigerator for 4 hours or overnight. (Up to 24 hours is ok.)\n",
      "In a large bowl using a hand-held mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and flour together until smooth and combined. Transfer the mixture to a silicone baking mat lined or parchment paper lined baking sheet. (Silicone baking mat is preferred because you can easily peel the butter off in the next step.) Using a spoon or small spatula, smooth out into a 7&#215;10-inch rectangle. Be as precise as you can with this measurement. Place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and chill the butter layer for 30 minutes. (No need to cover it for only 30 minutes.) You want the butter layer firm, but still pliable. If it gets too firm, let it sit out on the counter for a few minutes to gently soften. The more firm the butter layer is the more difficult it will be to laminate the dough in the next step.\n",
      " In this next step, you will be rolling out the dough into a large rectangle. Do this on a lightly floured counter instead of rolling out on your silicone baking mat. The counter is typically a little cooler (great for keeping the dough cold) and the silicone baking mat is smaller than the measurement you need. Remove both the dough and butter layers from the refrigerator. Place the butter layer in the center of the dough and fold each end of the dough over it. If the butter wasn’t an exact 7&#215;10-inch rectangle, use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to even out the edges. Seal the dough edges over the butter layer as best you can with your fingers. On a lightly floured counter, roll the dough into a 10&#215;20-inch rectangle. It’s best to roll back and forth with the shorter end of the dough facing you, like I do in the video above. Use your fingers if you need to. The dough is very cold, so it will take a lot of arm muscle to roll. Again, the dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working it with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct size rectangle. Fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter. This was the 1st turn.\n",
      "If the dough is now too warm to work with, place folded dough on the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 30 minutes before the 2nd turn. I usually don’t have to.\n",
      " Turn the dough so the short end is facing you. Roll the dough out once again into a 10&#215;20-inch rectangle, then fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter. The dough must be refrigerated between the 2nd and 3rd turn because it has been worked with a lot by this point. Place the folded dough on the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 30 minutes before the 3rd turn.\n",
      "Roll the dough out once again into a 10&#215;20-inch rectangle. Fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter.\n",
      "Place the folded dough on the lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight. (Up to 24 hours is ok.)\n",
      "At the end of the next step, you’ll need 2 baking sheets lined with silicone baking mats or parchment paper. The dough is currently on a lined baking sheet in the refrigerator, so you already have 1 prepared!\n",
      "Remove the dough from the refrigerator. On a lightly floured counter, roll the dough out into an 8&#215;20-inch rectangle. Use your fingers if you need to. Once again, the dough is very cold, so it will take a lot of arm muscle to roll. The dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working it with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct size rectangle. Using a pizza cutter or sharp knife, slice the dough in half vertically. Each skinny rectangle will be 4-inches wide. Then cut 3 even slices horizontally, yielding 8 4&#215;5-inch rectangles. See photo and video above for a visual. Cut each rectangle diagonally to make 2 triangles. You have 16 triangles now. Work with one triangle at a time. Using your fingers or a rolling pin, stretch the triangle to be about 8 inches long. Do this gently as you do not want to flatten the layers. Cut a small slit at the wide end of the triangle, then tightly roll up into a crescent shape making sure the tip is underneath. Slightly bend the ends in towards each other. Repeat with remaining dough, placing the shaped croissants on 2 lined baking sheets, 8 per sheet. Loosely cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and allow to rest at room temperature (no warmer! I suggest just keeping on the counter) for 1 hour, then place in the refrigerator to rest for 1 hour or up to 12 hours. (Or freeze, see freezing instructions.) I prefer the shaped croissants to be cold going into the oven. When you poke the dough with your finger, it will slowly bounce back. That means they are ready to be baked.\n",
      "Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C).\n",
      "Whisk the egg wash ingredients together. Remove the croissants from the refrigerator. Brush each lightly with egg wash.\n",
      " Bake until croissants are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Rotate the pans halfway through baking. If croissants show signs of darkening too quickly, reduce the oven to 375°F (190°C).\n",
      "Remove croissants from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool for a few minutes before serving. They will slightly deflate as they cool.\n",
      "Croissants taste best the same day they’re baked. Cover any leftover croissants and store at room temperature for a few days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. You can also freeze for up to 3 months, then thaw on the counter or overnight in the refrigerator. Warm up to your liking.\n"

       " {'instructions': 'For the dough: Put the eggs and water in a large mixing bowl. Add 1 tablespoon of the sugar, 3 cups (362g) of the flour, and the yeast. Mix until well blended; set aside to let the sponge work., For the butter: Cut the butter into 1˝ chunks and combine with the salt and flour at low speed in a stand mixer just until smooth, with no lumps. Be careful not to beat too much; you don’t want to incorporate any air., Spread the butter on a piece of plastic wrap and shape into an 8˝ square. Wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes., Finish the dough: Add the melted butter to the sponge. Whisk together the remaining sugar, 2 1/2 cups (298g) of the flour, the dry milk, and salt and add to the sponge. Mix until the dough forms. Knead for 5 minutes; touch the dough lightly with your finger. If it’s still sticky, add the remaining flour 2 tablespoons at a time until the dough is the desired consistency. Once the dough is smooth and elastic, pat it into a 9˝ square, then wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes., To laminate the dough: Remove the chilled dough from the refrigerator and gently roll it to a 12\" square., Unwrap the butter square and place it in the center of the dough at a 45° angle, so it looks like a diamond in a square. Pull the corners of the dough into the center of the butter diamond. Moisten the edges with a little water and pinch the seams together well to enclose the butter. Dust the top with flour and turn the packet over., Tap the dough all over with a rolling pin, encouraging it into a rectangular shape. Once it’s pliable, roll it to a 20˝ x 10˝ rectangle, picking it up and dusting lightly with flour as needed., When you’ve reached the proper size, use a dry brush to sweep off any excess flour and fold the dough in thirds, like a business letter. Take care to keep the edges straight and line them up directly over each other. If the dough slides around, use a little water at the corners to tack them in place. This is your first turn., Rotate the dough out so it looks like a book about to be opened. Roll the dough out once more to 20˝ x 10˝ and fold it as before. This is the second turn. Wrap the dough and refrigerate it for 30 minutes to allow the gluten in the dough to relax., Give the dough two more turns after its rest, then wrap the dough well and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight before using. You can also freeze the dough at this point., To shape the croissants: Cut the packet of dough in half. Wrap and refrigerate or freeze one half., Roll the other half to a 13˝ x 18˝ rectangle. Trim the edges about 1/4˝ all the way around with a ruler and pizza cutter. This removes the folded edges that would inhibit the dough’s rise., Cut the dough in thirds lengthwise and in half down the center. This will give you six 4˝ x 9˝ pieces. Cut these pieces in half diagonally and arrange them so the points are facing away from you. Stretch them gently to make them a little longer, then cut a 1˝ notch in the center of the base of each triangle., Take the two inside corners of the notch and roll them up toward you, building a curved shape as you roll the base of the dough toward the tip. Make sure the tip ends up under the bottom of the croissant. Place the shaped pastry on a parchment-lined baking sheet, curving the ends toward each other. Refrigerate for 30 minutes., Take the croissants out of the refrigerator, and let them warm and rise for 60 to 90 minutes at room temperature. They should expand noticeably, and when you gently press one with your finger, the indentation should remain., Towards the end of the rise time, preheat the oven to 425°F. Brush each croissant with an egg beaten with 1 tablespoon water. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven’s temperature to 350°F and bake for 10 to 15 minutes more, until deep golden brown and no raw dough is visible where the layers overlap. Remove from the oven and let cool on the pan on a rack for 20 minutes before serving.',\n",

       " {'instructions': 'It’s all about the layers…\\nKlik hier voor Nederlandse versie\\nWith this recipe we want to give you the exact directions on how we go about making classic French croissants. The recipe is an adaptation from the recipe for Classic Croissants by Jeffrey Hamelman. We started out largely following the instructions for his recipe, changed everything to our beloved metric system and found out some worthwhile croissant knowledge of our own along the way. Hopefully enough to justify sharing it all with you and inspiring you to give croissant baking a shot yourself. \\nBefore you start we can recommend watching our croissant making video to get a general feel for the recipe. You can also check out our croissant making log where we keep track of our own croissant baking adventures. For answers to your croissant questions you can check out the Frequently Asked Croissant Questions section.\\nThis recipe will yield about 15 good croissants plus some leftover bits which you can use to make a few, slightly odd shaped ones, or other inventive croissant-like creations.  \\nIf at first you don’t succeed, maybe you can take comfort from the fact that our first efforts were not very ‘croissant worthy’. But as you can see we persevered and got better…But we have to admit it is and always will be a tricky process. You have to work precise and be focused to get good results. So away with screaming children, hyperactive animals and all other things distracting! Put on some appropriate croissant making music and lets get to it…    \\nPlease read the following tips;\\nThere is no way to hide little mistakes in your technique when making croissants. Do not expect to get perfect croissants the very first time you try our recipe, most people need to make them 3 to 4 times to get the general feeling for the process. There is no substitute for practice and experience. But best of all and most important, enjoy the process!\\nPlease try this recipe exactly as written down at least 3 times before starting experimenting with spelt, freezing, retarding, margarine, timing, sourdough etc. If you can make a croissant resembling the ones you see in the pictures you are ready for the next step. Learn to walk before you try to run!\\nEvery type / brand of flour and butter type also makes a difference. Try a few flours to find the one in your area which hits the balance between strength and flexibility. The same with butter, it needs to be pliable but not too soft. We use an organic butter with a low water content. A higher water content tends to make butter hard, which promotes tearing and breaking and ruins the layers. The butter we use has written on the package ‘at least 82%’ butterfat’. So please if possible use the right butter!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to Raymond Calvel croissants laminated with margarine are formed into the crescent shape, while croissants laminated with butter are left in the straight form. We say, use whichever shape you like best, but do use butter!\\nThe croissant recipe\\n\\n\\nIngredients for the croissant dough\\n\\n500 g  French Type 55 flour or unbleached all-purpose flour / plain flour (extra for dusting)\\n140 g water\\n140 g whole milk (you can take it straight from the fridge)\\n55 g sugar\\n40 g soft unsalted butter\\n11 g instant yeast\\n12 g salt\\n\\n\\n\\nOther ingredients\\nmakes 15\\n\\n280 g cold unsalted butter for laminating\\n1 egg + 1 tsp water for the egg wash \\n\\n\\nFirst time croissant baker? Choose a cold day with a room temperature below 20 ºC / 68 ºF . This way you will have more time for the whole process and less chance of your precious butter being absorbed by the dough. The key is to keep the butter solid between the layers of dough, this is what gives the croissant its flaky layers.\\nDay 1\\nMaking the croissant dough\\nWe usually do this part in the evening. Combine the dough ingredients and knead for 3 minutes, at low to medium speed, until the dough comes together and you’ve reached the stage of low to moderate gluten development. You do not want too much gluten development because you will struggle with the dough fighting back during laminating. Shape the dough like a disc, not a ball, before you refrigerate it, so it will be easier to roll it into a square shape the following day. Place the disc on a plate, cover with clingfilm and leave in the fridge overnight.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDay 2\\nLaminating the dough\\nCut the cold butter (directly from the fridge) lengthwise into 1,25 cm thick slabs. Arrange the pieces of butter on waxed paper to form a square of about 15 cm x 15 cm. Cover the butter with another layer of waxed paper and with a rolling pin pound butter until it’s about 19 cm x 19 cm. Trim / straighten the edges of the butter and put the trimmings on top of the square. Now pound lightly until you have a final square of 17 cm x 17 cm. Wrap in paper and refrigerate the butter slab until needed. \\nUse just enough flour on your work surface to prevent the dough from sticking. However keep the amount to a minimum, otherwise too much flour will be incorporated between the layers and this will show in the end result.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTake the dough out of the fridge. With a rolling pin roll out the dough disc into a 26 cm x 26 cm square. Try to get the square as perfect as possible and with an even thickness. Get the slab of butter from the fridge. Place the dough square so one of the sides of the square is facing you and place the butter slab on it with a 45 degree angle to the dough so a point of the butter square is facing you. Fold a flap of dough over the butter, so the point of the dough reaches the center of the butter. Do the same with the three other flaps. The edges of the dough flaps should slightly overlap to fully enclose the butter. With the palm of your hand lightly press the edges to seal the seams. \\n\\nNow the dough with the sealed in butter needs to be rolled out. With a lightly floured rolling pin start rolling out, on a lightly flour dusted surface, the dough to a rectangle of 20 x 60 cm. Start rolling from the center of the dough towards the edges, and not from one side of the dough all the way to the other side. This technique helps you to keep the dough at an even thickness. You can also rotate your dough 180 degrees to keep it more even, because you tend to use more pressure when rolling away from you than towards yourself. You can use these techniques during all the rolling steps of this recipe. Aim at lengthening the dough instead of making it wider and try to keep all edges as straight as possible. \\nFold the dough letter style, cover with clingfilm and refrigerate for 30 minutes (fold one third of the dough on top of itself and then fold the other side over it). Repeat the rolling and folding two more times (ending up with 27 layers of butter in total), each time rolling until the dough is about 20 cm x 60 cm. After each fold you should turn the dough 90 degrees before rolling again. The open ‘end’ of the dough should be towards you every time when rolling out the dough (you can see this in our croissant making video at around 3:40 minutes). After the second turn, again give it a 30 minute rest in the fridge. After the third turn you leave the dough in the fridge overnight until day 3, the actual croissant making day!\\nSometimes the dough will resist to get any longer than for example 45 cm, stop rolling and pressing the dough, it will only hurt your layers. At any stage when the rolling of the dough gets harder you can cover the dough and let the gluten relax for 10 to 20 minutes in the fridge before continuing. \\n\\nRoll out to 20 cm x 60 cm\\nFold\\nRefrigerate 30 minutes\\nRotate 90 degrees\\nRoll out to 20 cm x 60 cm\\nFold\\nRefrigerate 30 minutes\\nRotate 90 degrees\\nRoll out to 20 cm x 60 cm\\nFold\\nRefrigerate until day 3\\nRotate 90 degrees\\nRoll out to 20 cm x 110 cm\\n\\nAlso see complete time table at bottom of page\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEach laminating step should not take more than a few minutes. However if, due to initial inexperience for example, it should take you longer, you can fold your dough letter style, cover it and refrigerate it for 20 minutes and continue the rolling process after this rest. It is very important the butter stays solid.\\n\\nDay 3\\nDividing the dough\\nTake the dough from the fridge. Lightly flour your work surface. Now very gently roll the dough into a long and narrow strip of 20 cm x 110 cm. If the dough starts to resist too much or shrink back during this process you can fold it in thirds and give it a rest in the fridge for 10 to 20 minutes before continuing. Do not fight the dough, when the dough refuses to get any longer, rest it in the fridge! It is such a shame to ruin two days of work.\\nWhen your dough has reached its intended shape, carefully lift it a few centimeters to allow it to naturally shrink back from both sides. This way it will not shrink when you cut it. Your strip of dough should be long enough to allow you to trim the ends to make them straight and still be left with a length of about 100 cm.   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShaping the croissants\\nFor the next stage you will need a tape measure and a pizza wheel. Lay a tape measure along the top of the dough. With the wheel you mark the top of the dough at 12,5 cm intervals along the length (7 marks total). Now lay the tape measure along the bottom of the dough and make a mark at 6,25 cm. Then continue to make marks at 12,5 cm intervals from this point (8 marks total). So the bottom and the top marks do not align with each other and form the basis for your triangles.\\nNow make diagonal cuts starting from the top corner cutting down to the first bottom mark. Make diagonal cuts along the entire length of the dough. Then change the angle and make cuts from the other top corner to the bottom mark to create triangles. Again repeat this along the length of the dough. This way you will end up with 15 triangles and a few end pieces of dough. \\n\\nUsing your pizza wheel, make 1.5 cm long notches in the center of the short side of each dough triangle. \\nNow very gently elongate each triangle to about 25 cm. This is often done by hand, but we have found that elongating with a rolling pin, very carefully, almost without putting pressure on the dough triangle, works better for us. You can try both methods and see what you think gives the best result. \\nAfter you cut a notch in the middle of the short end of the triangle, try and roll the two wings by moving your hands outwards from the center, creating the desired shape with a thinner, longer point. Also try and roll the dough very tightly at the beginning and put enough pressure on the dough to make the layers stick together (but not so much as to damage the layers of course).  \\n\\nProofing and baking\\nArrange the shaped croissants on baking sheets, making sure to keep enough space between them so they will not touch when proofing and baking. Combine the egg with a teaspoon of water and whisk until smooth. Give the croissants their first thin coating of egg wash. \\nProof the croissants draft-free at an ideal temperature of 24ºC to 26.5ºC / 76ºF to 79ºF (above that temperature there is a big chance butter will leak out!). We use our small Rofco B20 stone oven as a croissant proofing cabinet by preheating it for a minute to 25ºC / 77ºF. It retains this temperature for a long time because of the oven stones and isolation. The proofing should take about 2 hours. You should be able to tell if they are ready by carefully shaking the baking sheet and see if the croissants slightly wiggle. You should also be able to see the layers of dough when looking at your croissants from the side. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPreheat the oven at 200ºC / 390ºF convection or 220ºC / 430ºF conventional oven.\\n\\nRight before baking, give the croissants their second thin coat of egg wash. We bake the croissants in our big convection oven for 6 minutes at 195ºC / 385ºF, then lowering the temperature to 165ºC / 330ºF, and bake them for another 9 minutes. Hamelman suggest baking the croissants for 18 to 20 minutes at 200ºC / 390ºF , turning your oven down a notch if you think the browning goes too quickly. But you really have to learn from experience and by baking several batches what the ideal time and temperature is for your own oven. Take out of the oven, leave for a few minutes on the baking sheet, then transfer to a cooling rack.\\nLatest way of baking; We heat up our double fan big convection oven at 200ºC, when heated up put the croissants in the oven and directly lower it to 175ºC. We bake them for 10 minutes at 175ºC, they will have a nice brown color by now, then lower the temperature to 150ºC, and bake them for another 6 minutes.\\nBest eaten while warm and fresh of course. Croissant we don’t eat or share within a day we freeze. We put them in the preheated oven (180ºC / 355ºF) for 8 minutes straight from the freezer. Nothing wrong with that, croissants eaten nice and warm, almost as good as the fresh ones…almost!\\nWe used the excess dough we trimmed from the edges to make, a bit odd shaped but still very delicious, ‘pain au chocolat’, using our favorite Valrhona Caraïbe dark chocolate. The trimmed dough parts are still worth using, it would be a shame to throw them away!\\nCroissant Time Table\\nTimes are an indication and also depend on your experience with the recipe\\nTry to work swift but precise and take extra fridge time if needed! \\nDay 1 – Make initial dough\\n\\n21.00 h – Knead for 3 minutes and store in fridge for 12 hours\\n\\nDay 2 – Laminate the dough\\n\\n09.00 h – Make butter slab and refrigerate till needed\\n09.05 h – Roll dough disc into square\\n09.10 h – Seal butter in dough\\n09.15 h – Roll out to 20 cm x 60 cm and fold\\nRefrigerate 30 minutes\\n09.50 h – Rotate 90 degrees\\nRoll out to 20 cm x 60 cm and fold\\nRefrigerate 30 minutes\\n10.25 h – Rotate 90 degrees\\nRoll out to 20 cm x 60 cm and fold\\n11.00 h – Refrigerate until day 3\\n\\nDay 3 – Dividing, Shaping, proofing and baking\\n\\n09.00 h – Roll out to 20 cm x 110 cm – part 1\\n09.05 h – Often needed!

       " {'instructions': 'Combine all of the dough ingredients in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Mix on low speed for 3 minutes, scraping the sides of the mixing bowl once if necessary. Mix on medium speed for 3 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured 10-inch pie pan or a dinner plate. Lightly flour the top of the dough and wrap well with plastic so it doesn’t dry out. Refrigerate overnight.The next day, cut the cold butter lengthwise into 1/2-inch-thick slabs. Arrange the pieces on a piece of parchment or waxed paper to form a 5- to 6-inch square, cutting the butter crosswise as necessary to fit. Top with another piece of parchment or waxed paper. With a rolling pin, pound the butter with light, even strokes. As the pieces begin to adhere, use more force. Pound the butter until it’s about 7-1/2 inches square and then trim the edges of the butter. Put the trimmings on top of the square and pound them in lightly with the rolling pin. Refrigerate while you roll out the dough.Unwrap and lay the dough on a lightly floured work surface. Roll into a 10-1/2-inch square. Brush excess flour off the dough. Remove the butter from the refrigerator—it should be pliable but cold. If not, refrigerate a bit longer. Unwrap and place the butter on the dough so that the points of the butter square are centered along the sides of the dough. Fold one flap of dough over the butter toward you, stretching it slightly so that the point just reaches the center of the butter. Repeat with the other flaps . Then press the edges together to completely seal the butter inside the dough. (A complete seal ensures butter won’t escape.)Lightly flour the top and bottom of the dough. With the rolling pin, firmly press the dough to elongate it slightly and then begin rolling instead of pressing, focusing on lengthening rather than widening the dough and keeping the edges straight.Roll the dough until it’s 8 by 24 inches. If the ends lose their square shape, gently reshape the corners with your hands. Brush any flour off the dough. Pick up one short end of the dough and fold it back over the dough, leaving one-third of the other end of dough exposed. Brush the flour off and then fold the exposed dough over the folded side. Put the dough on a baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and freeze for 20 minutes to relax and chill the dough.Repeat the rolling and folding, this time rolling in the direction of the two open ends until the dough is about 8 by 24 inches. Fold the dough in thirds again, as shown in the photo\\xa0above, brushing off excess flour and turning under any rounded edges or short ends with exposed or smeared layers. Cover and freeze for another 20 minutes.Give the dough a third rolling and folding. Put the dough on the baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap, tucking the plastic under all four sides. Refrigerate overnight.The next day, unwrap and lightly flour the top and bottom of the dough. With the rolling pin, “wake the dough up” by pressing firmly along its length—you don’t want to widen the dough but simply begin to lengthen it with these first strokes. Roll the dough into a long and narrow strip, 8 inches by about 44 inches. If the dough sticks as you roll, sprinkle with flour. Once the dough is about half to two-thirds of its final length, it may start to resist rolling and even shrink back. If this happens, fold the dough in thirds, cover, and refrigerate for about 10 minutes; then unfold the dough and finish rolling. Lift the dough an inch or so off the table at its midpoint and allow it to shrink from both sides—this helps prevent the dough from shrinking when it’s cut. Check that there’s enough excess dough on either end to allow you to trim the ends so they’re straight and the strip of dough is 40 inches long. Trim the dough.Lay a yardstick or tape measure lengthwise along the top of the dough. With a knife, mark the top of the dough at 5-inch intervals along the length (there will be 7 marks in all). Position the yardstick along the bottom of the dough. Make a mark 2-1/2 inches in from the end of the dough. Make marks at 5-inch intervals from this point all along the bottom of the dough. You’ll have 8 marks that fall halfway between the marks at the top.Make diagonal cuts by positioning the yardstick at the top corner and the first bottom mark. With a knife or pizza wheel, cut the dough along this line. Move the yardstick to the next set of marks and cut. Repeat until you have cut the dough diagonally at the same angle along its entire length—you’ll have made 8 cuts. Now change the angle of the yardstick to connect the other top corner and bottom mark and cut the dough along this line to make triangles. Repeat along the entire length of dough. You’ll end up with 15 triangles and a small scrap of dough at each end.Using a paring knife or a bench knife, make a 1/2- to 3/4-inch-long notch in the center of the short side of each triangle. The notch helps the rolled croissant curl into a crescent. Hold a dough triangle so that the short notched side is on top and gently elongate to about 10 inches without squeezing or compressing the dough—this step results in more layers and loft.Lay the croissant on the work surface with the notched side closest to you. With one hand on each side of the notch, begin to roll the dough away from you, towards the pointed end.Flare your hands outward as you roll so that the “legs” become longer. Press down on the dough with enough force to make the layers stick together, but avoid excess compression, which could smear the layers. Roll the dough all the way down its length until the pointed end of the triangle is directly underneath the croissant. Now bend the two legs towards you to form a tight crescent shape and gently press the tips of the legs together (they’ll come apart while proofing but keep their crescent shape).Shape the remaining croissants in the same manner, arranging them on two large parchment-lined rimmed baking sheets (8 on one pan and 7 on the other). Keep as much space as possible between them, as they will rise during the final proofing and again when baked.Make the egg wash by whisking the egg with 1 tsp. water in a small bowl until very smooth. Lightly brush it on each croissant.Refrigerate the remaining egg wash (you’ll need it again). Put the croissants in a draft-free spot at 75° to 80°F. Wherever you proof them, be sure the temperature is not so warm that the butter melts out of the dough. They will take 1-1/2 to 2 hours to fully proof. You’ll know they’re ready if you can see the layers of dough when the croissants are viewed from the side, and if you shake the sheets, the croissants will wiggle. Finally, the croissants will be distinctly larger (though not doubled) than they were when first shaped.Shortly before the croissants are fully proofed, position racks in the top and lower thirds of the oven and heat it to 400°F convection, or 425°F conventional. Brush the croissants with egg wash a second time. Put the sheets in the oven. After 10 minutes, rotate the sheets and swap their positions. Continue baking until the bottoms are an even brown, the tops richly browned, and the edges show signs of coloring, another 8 to 10 minutes. If they appear to be darkening too quickly during baking, lower the oven temperature by 10°F. Let cool on baking sheets on racks.',\n",

       " {'instructions': 'The preparation of the croissants consists of two main phases: the initial dough, called détrempe, and the laminating, which consists of integrating the butter to the détrempe, forming alternate layers.\\nThe difficulty in making croissants at home lies in manually creating thin and even layers of dough/butter in order to achieve a product with good volume and an open, honey-comb texture.\\n\\nTools\\nFor making the dough and shaping the butter:\\n\\nClingfilm and freezer bag. It is important to correctly wrap the détrempe (and then the dough) in clingfilm and then put it inside a freezer bag to prevent it from drying out. It will also protect the dough against possible unpleasant smells inside the refrigerator.\\nWaxed paper, pencil and ruler.

Before rolling, place a tray (better if steel or marble) inside the freezer so you can place in it croissants once cut and keep them cold before shaping.\\nIce blocks. To keep the work surface cool at all times.\\nRolling pin. I use a stainless steel rolling pin because it has several advantages: it is non-stick and it’s heavy, so it saves me effort when handling some doughs. However, its weight can also be a disadvantage, especially if you have no experience in laminating. In fact, when we have no experience we usually tend to apply too much pressure on the rolling pin during laminating. So if we use a heavy rolling pin like the stainless steel one we may break the layers. Therefore, I do not recommend that you specifically buy this kind of rolling pin. If you already have it, it’s great but if not, a standard wooden rolling pin is perfectly fine. Once you have more experience in laminating, the stainless rolling pin is quite useful.\\nBrush. The brush will allow us to remove the excess flour without damaging the dough.\\nInfrared thermometer. It’s a necessary tool to control the temperature of the dough at all times. It’s cheap and very practical.\\nSharp knife or pizza steel.

What flour should we use to make croissants?\\nChoosing the right flour is very important to get croissants with the right volume and texture. As you can imagine, not all flours can be used. When choosing the flour, you have to check some technical data: baking strength, elasticity/tenacity ratio (P/L) and the protein percentage.\\n– Baking strength: choose a strong flour, which allows to develop gluten during kneading, but also during rolling. The strength of the flour is measured by the W factor. A strong flour has a factor that ranges between W320 and W380.\\n– P/L: the flour you choose not only has to be strong, but it has to maintain this strength over time, that is, during proofing and baking. The factor that determines the relationship between force and time is called «P/L» (i.e., elasticity & tenacity). The flour used for croissant should have a good P/L ratio to avoid the dough fighting back during laminating (between 0.4 and 0.7 approx., the higher this value is, the less elasticity the flour presents).\\n– Proteins: the percentage of proteins (i.e. gluten) goes hand in hand with the baking strength. The more strength, the more protein. It is very important that the flour you use is rich in proteins (between 13% and 15%), since the good development of the croissants depends to a large extent on it.\\nTo these three factors, I would add the water absorption power of the flour. It is difficult to measure it and you will have to try it by yourself. The hydration rate of the détrempe will depend on this factor (a flour that has a high water absorption power will need more hydration).\\nI usually use two flours that meet these characteristics: Lievitati flour (W350-370 – P / L 0.48 / 0.50 – Proteins> 13%) and flour Sfoglia (W300-320 – P / L 0.48 / 0.50 – Proteins> 13%), both from Molino Pasini. Like most specific flours they are not easy to find in regular stores and are usually sold in bags of 10 or 25 kg. Some of these flours are available online.\\n\\n2. Yeast, sourdough, preferment: which is the best way to ferment the croissants?\\nCroissants can be fermented using various methods, the three main ones being: yeast (direct method), a mix of preferment (poolish) and yeast, or a combination of sourdough and yeast.\\nSourdough\\nIf you do not have experience making croissants at home, I would not recommend to start using sourdough. Besides adding complexity to the process (a more precise organization and a greater control of the proofing phase), its use requires a fairly rigorous control of the sourness, especially if, like me, you do not use your sourdough daily and it stays weeks in the fridge. If the breads we bake can have a mildly sour taste, croissants cannot so we have to make sure that the sourdough we use to make croissants is not sour at all.\\nAfter many tests, I think it’s not that worth to use sourdough in the croissant formula. When I started making croissants at home, I used part of sourdough (30%) and a small amount of dry yeast (since making decent croissants using only sourdough is almost impossible, even for professional bakers), but it did not end to achieve the expected results with this combination: my croissants lacked a little volume and I didn’t get the texture I expected.\\nThere is a certain obsession with sourdough among home bakers (including myself!). The use of sourdough is essential for many breads, as it provides a special texture and helps extending the lifespan of the product (as in the case of Panettone, for example). However, a croissant is prepared for immediate consumption and, in this case, sourdough barely provides benefits in terms of texture and flavor. Of course you get great croissants using a part of sourdough (and as a personal challenge it’s fine!) but I personally achieved better results using fresh yeast.\\nPreferment\\nSome bakers (like Chad Roberston from Tartine), use poolish in their formula, a liquid preferment made with the same proportion of flour and water, and with a pinch of yeast (between 0.1% and 0,3%). It is usually prepared on the eve so that it ferments between 8 and 16 hours, and bakers usually use between 30% and 40% over the total weight of the flour of the détrempe.\\nIn theory, poolish allows to achieve a greater extensibility of the détrempe, which helps to better laminate the dough. Personally, I do not like this method as I think it brings more moisture to the dough, which forces us to have more control over hydration.\\nSome bakers also add a proportion of pâte fermentée («fermented dough», that is to say of previous détrempe) or even cuts of croissant dough in order to fully develop the croissant aromas; however I do not recommend it because it alters the formula (increasing the proportion of all ingredients, including yeast) and, consequently, proofing times.\\nDry yeast or fresh yeast?\\nThe best option for me (at least to begin with) is to use yeast.\\nI have tried both types of yeast (fresh and dry). At first I used dry yeast. However, I have stopped using it for several reasons. Firstly because it contains additives. Secondly because fermentation is slower and more difficult to control. And finally, I find it difficult to check the quality and condition of the dry yeast, since some of it has been packed for a long time and lose a lot of strength.\\nIn my opinion, the best option for making homemade croissants is to use only fresh yeast. It is easy to find and its use is very practical.\\nSome advices when using fresh yeast.\\nI buy it from one of the bakeries in my neighborhood. They sell it to the weight and they usually receive it daily so I know it is very fresh and of great quality. But you can use perfectly the one sold in supermarkets.\\n– Look carefully at the expiration date. Before using it, smell it: if it smells very strong or rancid throw it away.\\n– Do not freeze it: the bacteria it contains will end up dying.\\n– Keep it wrapped in cling film inside a tightly closed glass jar to prevent it from drying out and consume it quickly.\\n3. Why is sugar important in fermented doughs?\\nIn addition to providing flavor and color (favoring caramelization), sugar is part of the food for yeast. Bear in mind that during proofing, yeast consumes part of the sugars. The other part stays in the dough. Therefore, if we do not add sugar or use too little, our croissants will not ferment properly and will lose color and texture. Also keep in mind that sugar absorbs part of the moisture of the dough, so you have to adjust the amount of water depending on the amount of sugar.\\nCroissants usually carry between 8% and 15% sugar. You can use different kinds of sugars such as panela, coconut sugar, brown sugar, etc., taking into account that they will provide a different color and flavor to the final product. However, it is not advisable to use sweeteners (both liquid and granulated), since they have a greater sweetening power which would modify the texture and flavor.\\n4. Is it better to use water or milk?\\nAt first I only used water (and a very small amount of milk powder). However, according to several pro bakers, milk not only adds flavor but has an influence on elasticity during kneading (that is, during the formation of gluten). I usually use half water half semi-skim milk, and I find it a good balance between flavor and texture.\\nRegarding water, it’s better to use filtered water or spring water. If you use tap water, leave it a couple of hours inside a glass so that chlorine can evaporate.\\n5. Is it necessary to use eggs in the croissants dough?\\nAlthough some recipes add egg, croissant dough does NOT carry egg. Other similar doughs, such as the Danish pastry, do carry it. Egg would provide a rather “brioche” texture, but in the case of croissants we are looking for a drier and lighter texture.\\n6. Is it essential to add salt?\\nYes, especially in fermented doughs. First of all because it strengthens the gluten and increases the absorption of water. And secondly because it slows down the activity of the yeast. In the case of croissants, we do not want the dough to ferment during the whole process; salt helps us to slown down fermentation.\\n7. What is malted barley flour for?\\nI use malted barley flour in many of my breads not only to enhance the flavor, but also to improve the crust. I love the touch it gives to croissants, but it is a very personal criterion and its use is completely optional. You can find it in specialized stores and in organic food shops.\\n8. What is the best butter for laminating?\\nButter is the characteristic flavor of a good croissant. That is why it is very important to choose a good quality butter. Professionals often use special «dry» butter specific for puff pastry, which percentage of fat is 84% (2% more than standard butter) and whose melting point (i.e. the point at which the butter begins to melt) is higher (34 ºC while that of standard butter is 28ºC). These characteristics facilitate the work of professional bakers by providing them with a butter that is easier to work with, with a lower degree of humidity and that withstands the high temperatures of the bakeries.\\nHowever, they are not easy to get and are often reserved to professional bakers. While it is true that this type of butter is ideal for making croissants and that its flavor is incomparable, it is not worth buying it. I have tried several butters of different brands and I can assure you that you can get great results using a butter of good quality from the supermarket. I usually use organic French butter (from Président). You will have to try until you find the one you like the most.\\nOf course, forget about shortening or low-fat products.\\n\\nHow to make croissant dough\\nAlthough there are many croissant recipes available, there are few variations from one to the other. After all, croissants almost always have the same ingredients, only the proportions vary. At the beginning it is normal to follow strictly the available formulas. But there is no perfect formula, especially because each of us uses different ingredients in different places. Using the same formula we would obtain different results depending on the type of flour we have and depending on the place we live (it is not the same to make croissants in Madrid, where the climate is very dry, than in the North of Spain, very rainy and humid).\\nThe success of a recipe depends not only on the ingredients and the steps to follow, but also on other factors more complex to control such as the ambient temperature, the degree of humidity, the temperature of the dough after kneading, the power of the oven, etc. That is why it’s important to investigate, to try different flours and butters and to modify the quantities according to our needs, but also to be very methodical in all the phases of the process, i.e. to control the temperature of the dough and the proofing times, to let the dough rest between the folds, etc. Only then we will achieve a final product according to our requirements.\\nThe formula that I propose below is nothing exceptional: I have been testing and adapting different recipes of great pastry chefs (Thomas Marie, Pierrick Challamel, Philippe Conticini, Daniel Alvarez, among others) to find a formula adapted to my needs.\\n\\nIngredients\\nFor the croissant initial dough (détrempe)\\n300 g strong flour (Lievitati from Molino Pasini) (100%)\\n80 g cold water (26.6%)\\n79 g cold semi-skimmed milk (26.4%)\\n45 g sugar (15%)\\n30 g unsalted butter (softened) (10%)\\n6 g salt (2%)\\n9 g fresh yeast (3%)\\n2 g malted barley (0.6%)\\nFor laminating\\n171 g butter (31% of the total détrempe weight)\\nOrganization\\nDay 1 (Saturday)\\n– 7:00 pm: make the détrempe and chill it in the freezer.\\n– 7.30 pm: prepare the butter block and keep it in the fridge overnight.\\n– 8.30 pm: remove the détrempe from the freezer and store it in the fridge overnight.\\nDay 2 (Sunday)\\n– 8.00 am: start laminating, first fold.\\n– 9.00 am: second fold\\n– 10.00 am: third fold\\n– 11.30 am: cut and shape the croissants and let them ferment\\n– 2.30-3.00 pm: bake the croissants\\nDAY 1 – SATURDAY\\n7.00 pm – Détrempe (initial dough)\\nPlace all ingredients, except the butter, into the bowl of the stand mixer and knead about 4 minutes at minimum speed.\\nI insist on the fact that the liquids have to be very cold to prevent the dough from overheating and begin to ferment during kneading. The temperature of the dough at the end of the kneading phase should not exceed 22 degrees C.\\nOn the other hand, you may have to adjust the hydration percentage depending on the water absorption capacity of your flour, taking into account that the more hydrated is the dough, the harder it’ll be to get an open crumb (however the dough will be easier to laminate). After 4 minutes, add the softened butter and continue kneading 3 or 4 minutes at the same speed.\\nWe have to develop the gluten so that the dough supports the later phase of integration of the butter, but not 100%, since we will continue to develop gluten during laminating. A kneading between 8 and 10 minutes is usually enough, although everything will depend on the flour your use and on the power & type of your stand mixer. Strong flours require a soft and slow kneading to avoid giving too much tension to the dough. We do not want too much gluten development because we will struggle extending the dough during laminating. The final dough has to have a smooth texture and with some elasticity (but not too much), and does not have to stick to your hands or the work surface.\\nWhen the dough is ready, shape it as a disc with the palm of your hand so it can cool faster, wrap it well in plastic wrap and place it inside a freezer bag. Put the dough in the freezer so that it cools quickly, without it becoming frozen (between an hour and an hour and a half depending on the temperature of your freezer).\\n[Note: all videos have English subtitles. You can turn them on by clicking the Settings wheel in the lower part of the screen.]\\n\\nSome formulas state that it’s possible to completely freeze the détrempe for a later use. I do not recommend it since the yeast weakens and even dies depending on the freezing time. It is better to give it a cold snap and keep it in the refrigerator (in the coldest part) until the next day.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Important note regarding the temperature of the détrempe\\nDon’t forget that we do not want the détrempe fo ferment before laminating. We want it to rest in the cold so that it relaxes and can be extended more easily. The experts say that to avoid the dough to start fermenting, the temperature has to be less than 6 ºC. However, the temperature of our refrigerators is usually much higher, although it indicates otherwise. Ideally, place a thermometer in the fridge to check the actual temperature and adjust it based on the thermometer value.\\nOur détrempe is ready and has to rest until the next day. You cannot make croissants being in a rush. The détrempe has to rest in cold for at least 12 hours (at a suitable temperature, I insist). I have tried to make croissants the same day but the results are much worse.\\n7.30 pm – Shaping butter\\nBefore going to bed, you must give the butter the right shape and thickness to be able to laminate the next day. Before cooling the détrempe, weigh it in order to calculate the percentage of butter that you will need to laminate. In this case, my dough weighs 551 grams and I want to use 31% butter on the total weight: 551 x 31/100 = 171 g.\\n\\nJust before going to bed, my advice is to leave the kitchen windows open: the colder the kitchen is, the better! Working in a cold environment (less than 18 ºC) is one of the keys to success for laminating. When it comes to handling butter it has to stay cold at all times (that’s why it’s almost impossible to make croissants in the summer: the butter melts and it’s impossible to laminate properly!). I also recommend you to put blocks of ice in the freezer so you can place them the next day on your work surface in order to keep it cold between the folds. The best material to laminate is marble, because it keeps cold, but steel or wood also works. Later I’ll talk about the temperature and texture that should have the dough to start laminating.\\nDAY 2 – SUNDAY\\n8.00 am – Laminating: enclosing butter in the détrempe and first fold\\nThe détrempe has rested all night in the fridge and the butter is shaped. We can start laminating. As I have mentioned before, it is very important to work in a cold environment!\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What is the ideal texture of détrempe and butter befor laminating?\\nSome croissant recipes state that to laminate correctly the détrempe and the butter must be at the same temperature. Well, this not quite correct. We shouldn’t think in terms of temperature, but in terms of texture or plasticity. Now, for butter and détrempe to have the same texture, their temperature cannot be the same. Butter tends to heat faster than the dough, so the dough (which is the one that seals the butter) has to be colder. As a general rule, I work with a dough at 8 or 9 ºC and with a butter between 11 and 13 ºC. You should control the temperature at all times with an infrared thermometer, although it’s very important to feel it with your hands, especially the butter: it has to be cold, but malleable (i.e., you should be able to bend it without breaking it: this is plasticity). If the butter is too soft and hot, it will come out of the dough during laminating and will end up mixing to the dough instead of creating layers. If, on the other hand, the butter is too hard and cold, it will end up cracking and you won’t be able to create layers. If you see that the butter and/or the dough heat up too much, do not hesitate to interrupt the process and cool them down.\\n\\n9.00 am – Second fold\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 How many folds are needed for croissants?\\nAs a general rule, croissants are given 1 double fold and 1 single fold, or 3 single folds. Although the more folds, less volume, I always do 3 simple folds because it is more practical: I find it easier to extend the dough with a simple fold. The double fold requires more strength and we may apply too much pressure and break the layers of dough/butter.\\n\\n10.00 am – Third fold\\nRepeat the process indicated in the previous video, wrap the dough in plastic film and let it rest an hour or an hour and a half in the fridge.\\n11.30 – Cutting and shaping\\nWe have given the last fold and the dough has rested in the refrigerator (the last rest before shaping is longer, minimum one hour). Now we must rolling it out to cut the croissants before shaping.\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Straight or half-moon croissants?\\nThere is a debate among purists about whether the croissant should be straight or half-moon. According to experts, a butter croissant has a straight shape, while a half-moon croissant is made with shortening. However, in the past it was the other way around: shortening appeared almost a century after the croissant was invented, so originally the real butter croissant had a half-moon shape (hence its name). With modernization and global economy, it was more expensive to produce butter croissants, so the shortening croissants (which takes less space and is more profitable) invaded the market. I choose the straight shape because it is simpler: I only have to roll the dough on itself once cut into triangles. The half-moon shape requires more technique.\\n12.00 am – Proofing\\nOur croissants are shaped and need to proof. To do this, we must place them on a non-stick tray (or covered with baking paper), leaving enough space between each croissant.\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is it possible to freeze shaped croissants in order to proof them at a later time?\\nIt’s possible although as I’ve already told, freezing and yeast are not quite compatible. If you decide to freeze the croissants, you always have to do it after shaping and before proofing; just place them carefully inside a freezing bag tightly closed. Of course, you should not keep them long in the freezer, since yeast will end up dying. When you are ready to bake them, let them de-freeze before proofing.\\nProofing is a key point that requires time so we cannot be in a hurry. When we work with fermented doughs, we usually have the bad habit of wanting to accelerate the fermentation process (i.e. by placing the dough near a heat source or in a preheated oven). For croissants, I do not recommend it for a simple reason: we have spent time and effort in laminating the dough so that our croissants come out the best we can and we do not want excess heat to melt the butter and spoil all our work. As a general rule, croissants must ferment at a temperature between 21 ºC and 24 ºC (and a humidity rate of approx. 75-80%). For this, it is very useful to have a thermometer at home that indicates the temperature and humidity. Therefore, it is preferable to leave the croissants ferment at room temperature in the warmest room of the house (which is usually the kitchen). Or directly inside the oven (off and without preheating). If it is too cold in your house, you can try to leave the oven light on (the temperature will rise a few degrees), but always watching that it does not exceed the maximum fermentation temperature.\\nHumidity is harder to control. In dry environments, as we are not professionals and we do not have fermentation chambers, the only thing left for us is to create a humid environment ourselves. The most effective option I have found is to place a bowl of hot water (at about 70 ºC, warmed up with a kettle) in the oven’s sole (as far as possible from the tray where the croissants are). The croissants are left to ferment with the oven door closed, placing the thermometer inside to control the temperature and humidity at all times. The water does not get to heat the environment excessively (since it cools quickly), but the humidity increases.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 How do we know that croissants are proofed and ready to bake?\\nAs with bread, fermentation is one of the most difficult processes to control.\\nThe finger test that we usually use for the bread dough (light pressure with the fingertip on the surface to check if the dough has fermented correctly) does not work for croissants. After fermentation, the croissant dough is very delicate and it is better not to touch it. The test will have to be visual.\\n\\nThe proofing time will depend on the above mentioned factors and you will have to control the croissants, which more or less have to double their initial volume (not more). However, the biggest the croissant is after shaping (that is, the more rolls you have given on it), the more time it will take to ferment. In my case, the croissants fermented 3 hours at about 24 ºC and an approximate humidity of 80%.\\n3.00 pm – Baking\\nPreheat the oven to 190 °C (convection) for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, introduce the tray of the proofed croissants in the fridge. Cooling the proofed croissants before baking them help us to coat them with egg wash more easily without crushing them. On the other hand, the contrast between cold and heat will help development in the oven.\\nAfter 15 minutes, take the tray out of the fridge and give the croissants a coat of egg wash (either only with egg or with a mixture of yolk & cream or milk). During this operation it is very important to wash ONLY the smooth parts and avoid washing the layers (otherwise the egg will seal the layers preventing them from expanding correctly).\\nBake at 190 ºC between 17 and 20 minutes depending on the size of the croissants, taking care not to open the oven.\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is it necessary to produce steam in the oven to bake the croissants?\\nIt’s not. If your initial dough was rather dry, you may want to produce steam during the first 5 minutes of baking. But it’s general not necessary, especially if you have fermented the croissants in a humid environment as I mentioned earlier.\\nWhen the croissants are browned and ready, remove them from the oven and let them cool completely on top of a rack.\\n\\nHow to keep the croissants once baked?\\nHomemade croissants are best eaten when freshly baked! If you want to keep them fresh, place them in a wooden box covered with a clean cloth.\\nIf the next day they have dried a little, a few seconds in the microwave will make them crispy again. You can also toast them, they are delicious!\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nLearn from your mistakes: problems that may arise during the process\\nThe best way to get a good result is to practice.\\nWhen I enclose the butter in the dough and begin to laminate, the butter leaks:\\n– The butter is too soft (hot)\\n– The détrempe is too hot and does not chill the butter enough\\n– The pressure on the roller is too high\\nWhen extending the dough to make the folds, the dough shrinks and cannot be extended correctly:\\n– Excess kneading of the dough\\n– Lack of hydration of the dough\\n– Lack of rest of the dough between the folds\\n– The dough is too hot and has started to ferment\\nIn the oven, the croissants develop well at the beginning but they end up losing volume:\\n– Initial temperature of the oven too high: the croissants grow too much at the beginning, which prevents a uniform development\\n– Excess of fermentation of the croissants\\n– Yeast in poor condition\\nIn the oven, the butter melts and a puddle forms around the croissants:\\n– Incorrect laminating (probably due to a too soft and hot butter): instead of forming layers that retain moisture, butter has been integrated into the dough and melts in the oven\\n– Fermentation temperature too high, which has caused the butter to start melting\\n– Oven temperature too high\\n\\nBibliography\\n\\xa0\\n– Daniel Álvarez, Sweet Devotion: una visión actual de la bollería artesana\\xa0– Vilbo Ediciones, 2017\\n– JM Lanio, T.

This simple measurement can dramatically affect everything from the fluidity of an ingredient, to the emulsification of a batter, to the way an ingredient dissolves or is incorporated into the larger creation.\\xa0 These descriptions are more than extra words in a recipe, they are the critical steps in creating that perfect chewy cookie, flaky pie crust or soft tender cake. I'll explain the ins and outs, and how to handle the science of temperature.\\xa0CHILL OUTLet's start with cold hard numbers, a.k.a. chilled ingredients. When a recipe calls for an ingredient to be chilled, 35 degrees Fahrenheit is the ideal temperature. When butter is cut into doughs such as pie crusts and laminated pastries (ex.: Danish and puff pastries), it needs to be extremely cold in order to create pockets of rich, flaky goodness. Among its components, butter is made of fat and water. When it’s incorporated properly into these doughs, the water evaporates to steam, creating lift, while the fat creates crisp layers. If butter is too warm, it will melt into the dough before it has a chance to act, ruining the layers and creating a soggy mess. Too cold, and the butter is too hard to properly, and evenly, mix in with the rest of the dough.PRO TIP: If your recipe calls for chilled butter, as with pie crusts, make sure not only your butter, but the other ingredients, and even equipment, are well-chilled. Refrigerating everything will help insure the ingredients remain cold as you work your magic.Likewise, properly chilled ingredients can make a night and day difference in recipes as simple as a mousse, or even a basic whipped cream. Removing heavy or whipping cream from the refrigerator right before adding it to a recipe allows the air pockets that develop as it is whipped to remain in place and expand, all due to the cold fat in the cream. Have you ever tried whipping warm heavy cream? You’ve probably found you get less volume in the whip. This is because the fat has softened, lessening the ability of the air pockets to form and set.\\xa0Pro Tip: Chilling the bowl of the stand mixer, ensure the cream stays cold throughout the whipping process.\\xa0NOT TOO HOT, NOT TOO COLD — JUST RIGHTScones, muffins, cakes, and cookies frequently use what many recipes call “the creaming method.” The creaming method is when sugar and fat are whipped together, aerating and expanding the butter.\\xa0 As the sugar moves through the butter, the tiny crystals create tiny air pockets that actually help the baked goods rise while they’re in the oven. Frequently, when recipes use the creaming method, they call for “room temperature” or “softened” butter. The best temperature for creaming butter is between 65 to 67 degrees Fahrenheit. Properly softened butter should give slightly when pressed, but still hold its shape. When butter is too cold, the butter and sugar can’t properly incorporate, and the resulting cakes and cookies are often dense and spongy. Eggs and milk, and other ingredients, should also be at room temperature to prevent the temperature of creamed butter and sugar from chilling.\\xa0\\xa0Speaking of eggs, room temperature eggs also play a large role in baked goods. If cold eggs are added to perfectly creamed sugar and butter, the batter will deflate; cold eggs chill the room temperature butter, making it stiff, and losing aeration. And when it comes to meringue, sugar and egg whites seem innocent enough right? Still, temperature is key. When egg whites are agitated (whipped) the proteins in the egg whites unravel and bond with the water in the whites, creating a foam. Room temperature proteins in the egg whites break down and whip up faster than cold egg whites.\\xa0PRO TIP: Shorten the time it takes for ingredients to come to room temperature with a few simple hacks. To soften butter, invert a warmed measuring cup or baking dish over the butter until it’s properly softened (add hot water to the measuring cup or baking dish, or place them in the microwave, to heat them up.) And placing eggs in hot water (around 110 degrees Fahrenheit) for just a few minutes will have you whipping up a recipe in no time.\\xa0“MELTED”Do you prefer chewy cookies and bars? (Of course you do.) Melted butter is key in creating perfectly chewy creations. Whether you melt your butter in a saucepan or microwave (zap it for 10 to 20 second intervals), it should be between 85 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit and slightly warm to the touch. If the butter is too hot, ou run the risk of scrambling the eggs or crystalizing the sugar in your batter.\\xa0LET’S GET BAKINGCroissants can be an intimidating pastry to create for the home baker. But with your knowledge of temperature, and my quick puff pastry method — sometimes called “a ruff puff” — you can cut your time, and effort, in half compared to traditional puff pastry recipes. Keeping everything just right, and you’ll have stunning croissants of your own in no time.— Dylan SimmonsQUICK AND EASY CROISSANTS5 hours.

When you cut into one you\\'ll find the \\n      dough has formed a beautiful honeycomb design with a texture that\\'s \\n      wonderfully soft. Yes, you can make them at home. While it\\'s a \\n      little time consuming, because of all the rest times, it\\'s \\n      worth every minute. And once you master the basic dough, you can make \\n      plain Croissants, Chocolate Croissants (pain au chocolat), Danish \\n      Pastries, as well as a host of other sweet and savory pastries. And \\n      Croissants that are a few days old can be used to make Almond Croissants \\n      (croissants aux amandes).\\xa0 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0I learned how to make Croissants \\n      when I took a two day hands-on class at the San Francisco Baking \\n      Institute (SFBI). Our wonderful instructor showed us all the ins and outs of \\n      making a great Croissant and we were able to make batch after batch to learn the craft. The recipe I give you here is from the SFBI, although I \\n      have modified it for the home baker. And if you\\'re ever in the Bay Area I \\n      highly recommend this baking school.A Croissant dough is a laminated \\n      dough. It\\'s similar to puff pastry only it contains yeast. That means you have two layers of \\n      slightly sweet dough with a layer of butter in \\n      between. As \\n      you may be aware, once the butter is encased in the dough it is rolled and \\n      folded into thirds, three times, with resting times in the refrigerator \\n      between the second and third fold. This does take several hours and it\\'s \\n      important not to rush the process.Croissants \\n      are not that difficult to make. It\\'s really all about precision and temperature. You must roll the dough to the required length and width and the \\n      temperature of the dough needs to stay cool. You will find that if the \\n      dough isn\\'t rolled thin enough your Croissant won\\'t have that \\n      beautiful honeycomb interior. Instead you may have just a big hole in the \\n      center surrounded by a thick layer of dough (looks more like a dinner \\n      roll than a Croissant). Also, when rolling and/or shaping the dough, if it \\n      gets too warm the butter will melt into the dough which again will affect \\n      the texture of the baked Croissant. So if, at any time, you find your \\n      dough is getting too soft or overly sticky when rolling, then return it to \\n      the fridge until it firms up. If you\\'re working in a very warm kitchen, I find it helpful to rub an ice pak over the \\n      counter to cool it off before you roll the dough.\\nA few notes on ingredients. The type of butter used will \\n      affect both the flavor and texture of your Croissant. For the butter layer \\n      it\\'s best to use a high fat unsalted butter (butter with 83% butterfat content) \\n      as it makes a flakier croissant with a more pronounced butter flavor. In the \\n      States this type of butter is normally labelled \"European style\" \\n      or \"cultured\". \\n      While we used a low protein bread flour at the SFBI, it can be hard to \\n      find so for this recipe I have used \\n      all purpose flour to make the dough. There is also a little \\n      \\ndry malt \\n      (diastatic) powder which breaks down the starch and gives sugar for the \\n      yeast to feed on. This is especially good for doughs, like this, that have a long \\n      fermentation period. Malt powder also aids in browning and helps the Croissant have \\n      a good rise. I have used \\n      \\nSAF Gold instant yeast \\n      in this recipe. This type of yeast is normally used by professionals as it gives a \\n      good rise, especially when making sweet breads with long fermentation \\n      periods. An added bonus is that since the grain particles are so small, you don\\'t have to \\n      proof it first. What\\'s great too, is that you can store it in the freezer \\n      and then just scoop out the amount you need. However, you \\n      can substitute with 10 grams (2 1/2 teaspoons) active dry yeast but I would \\n      activate the yeast in the water, with a 1/2 teaspoon of sugar, before \\n      making the dough. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated\\n          Recipes You May Like\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlmond Croissants\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlmond Brioche Toast (Bostock)\\n\\n\\n\\n        Danish Pastries\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChocolate Croissants\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBrioche Recipe\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSticky Buns\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHomemade Croissants: \\nIn a \\nlarge bowl combine the flour, yeast, sugar, and malt powder. Then stir in the salt. With your \\nfingertips work the butter into the dry ingredients until the butter is in small \\npieces and coated with flour. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the water \\nand milk. With a bench scraper or wooden spoon, gradually work the flour into the liquid, making sure \\nthat the dry ingredients are moistened. Then using your hands, work \\nthe dough for a minute or two to make sure all the dry ingredients are \\nthoroughly moistened. At this point the dough will be a sticky mass. Cover the bowl loosely \\nwith plastic wrap and let it ferment for about one hour (helps to develop flavor \\nand aroma) at room temperature (75 - 78 degrees F) (24 - 26 degrees C) . \\nAfter an hour transfer the \\ndough to a lightly floured surface and press or roll the dough into a 14 x 10 \\ninch (35 x 25 cm) rectangle. Transfer to a lightly floured baking sheet, sprinkle the top of \\nthe dough lightly with flour, cover with plastic wrap, and place in the \\nrefrigerator for at least six hours (or overnight).\\nAbout 15 minutes before you \\nwant to laminate the dough, \\xa0take a \\nsheet of parchment paper and draw a 10 x 7 inch (25 x 18 cm) rectangle on the paper. Flip the \\npaper over. Take your cold butter and cut it into six pieces. Place the cold \\nbutter within the drawn lines on your parchment paper and enclose it in the \\nparchment. With your rolling pin pound the cold butter to soften it a little. \\nThen fold the parchment paper to make a 10 x 7 inch rectangle (like an envelope) and roll the \\nbutter until it fits this size. Make sure the butter is of even thickness. At \\nthis point you want the butter to be cold but still pliable. It needs to be at \\nthe same temperature as the dough. If it\\'s too soft then place in the \\nrefrigerator for about 15 minutes. \\n\\nRolling out the dough \\n(lamination): The temperature of the \\ndough is important when rolling it out. It is best that your kitchen is cool. \\nHowever, I have found you can cool your countertop by running an ice pack over \\nthe surface before rolling.\\nRemove the sheet of dough and \\nyour butter from the refrigerator. Peel off the parchment paper from the butter \\nand place the butter onto the center of your dough. Wrap the edges of the dough over the \\nbutter so they meet in the center. Press lightly to seal the edges. (The edges \\nof the dough and the butter should be even.)\\nFirst Turn: Transfer the \\ndough to a lightly floured surface with the sealed edges running vertical. With \\nyour rolling pin gently tap the dough and then roll the dough vertically into a \\n22 x 8 inch (55 x 20 cm) rectangle. Lift the dough frequently as you roll so the dough \\ndoesn\\'t stick. Flour as necessary. Roll end to end, not side to side, making sure the dough is of \\neven thickness. When it\\'s at the correct length and width, fold the dough \\nlengthwise into thirds, like you\\'re folding a letter. Make sure the edges of the \\ndough are straight and even. You now have your first turn.\\nSecond Turn: Rotate the \\ndough 90 degrees so the folded edge is on your left (like the binding of a \\nbook). Repeat the process of rolling your dough to 22 x 8 inches (55 x 20 cm) and fold the \\ndough again into thirds. This is now your second turn. Place the dough on a \\nlightly floured baking sheet, lightly flour the top of the dough, cover with plastic wrap, and place in the \\nrefrigerator to chill one hour.\\nThird Turn: Take the \\nchilled dough and repeat the rolling and folding into thirds one more time. This \\nis your third turn. Again, place your dough on a floured baking sheet, flour the \\ntop of the dough, cover, and \\nrefrigerate one hour.\\nSheeting: On a lightly floured \\nsurface roll your dough into a 16 x 9 inch (40 x 23 cm) rectangle. Again, place \\non a lightly floured baking sheet, lightly flour the top, cover, and refrigerate \\n30-60 minutes (at this point the dough can be stored overnight in the \\nrefrigerator.)\\nShaping the Croissants: \\nLine two baking sheets with parchment paper. Make a triangular template from a \\npiece of hard plastic or cardboard that measures  about 3 3/4 inches (9.5 cm) across \\nthe base and about 9 inches (23 cm) high. On a lightly floured surface roll your \\ndough into a 24 x 9 inch (61 x 23 cm) rectangle. Make sure to lift the dough frequently so it \\ndoesn\\'t stick and this also allows the dough to shrink back. Then trim the \\nlong edges of the dough with a sharp knife or pizza wheel. Use the template as a \\nguide to cut the dough into 11 triangles. \\nWorking with one triangle at a \\ntime, hold the wide end of the \\ntriangle in one hand and using your other hand, gently run your hand down the \\nlength of the dough to lengthen it. Then place the triangle on your surface \\nand cut a small slit in the center of the wide end of your dough. Starting at \\nthe wide end, roll the dough into a crescent shape. Do this gently as you don\\'t \\nwant to compress the layers. Place on your baking sheet \\nand repeat with the remaining triangles. \\nIn a small bowl whisk the egg \\nwith the egg yolks. Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the tops and sides of \\neach croissant. Place each baking sheet in a large plastic bag and let proof for \\nabout 1 1/2 to 2 hours at room temperature (75 - 78 degrees F) (24 - 26 degrees C). You \\nknow the croissants are proofed when you gently shake your baking sheet, the \\ncroissants will wiggle. Also the croissants will be soft to the touch.\\nPreheat your oven to 400 \\ndegrees (200 degrees C). Place your oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of \\nyour oven.\\nBrush the Croissants again with \\nthe egg wash. Place the two baking sheets of Croissants in the preheated oven \\nand bake 10 minutes. Rotate your baking sheet top to bottom and front to back. \\nReduce your oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and bake for an \\nadditional 10 minutes or until golden brown and firm to the touch.\\nRemove from oven and place on a \\nwire rack to cool. Croissants are best the day they\\'re made.\\nMakes \\nabout 11 Croissants.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nView comments on this recipe on YouTube\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Croissant Dough:\\n\\n        475 grams (3 2/3 cups) all-purpose flour\\n\\n        6 grams (1 3/4 teaspoons) SAF Gold instant yeast \\n\\nAvailable on Amazon\\n65 grams\\n         (1/3 cup) granulated white sugar\\n2 grams (2/3 \\n        teaspoon) dry malt (diastatic) powder \\n\\nAvailable on Amazon\\n\\n        10 grams (2 1/2 teaspoons) salt  \\n25 grams (2 \\n        tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature\\n\\n        240 grams (1\\n        cup) water, at room temperature\\n\\n        30 grams (3 tablespoons) cream, at room \\n        temperature\\n\\n        225 grams (1 cup) cold unsalted European \\n        style \\'cultured\\' butter \\n\\n\\n        Glaze: \\n\\n        2\\n        large egg yolks (about 35 grams)\\n\\n        1 large egg (50 grams)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Let the sponge stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Lightly grease a large bowl with olive oil. In a small saucepan, heat the milk until lukewarm. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine both of the flours with the sugar, salt and yeast. Scrape in the sponge. At low speed, drizzle in the lukewarm milk and mix just until the dough comes together. Let stand for 10 minutes. Knead the dough at low speed until it forms a ball, about 3 minutes. Transfer to the prepared bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Punch down and refrigerate for 3 hours. Meanwhile, on a sheet of parchment paper, arrange the sticks of butter side by side so they touch. Cover with another sheet of parchment. Using a rolling pin, pound the butter flat and roll out to a 10-by-12-inch rectangle. Refrigerate until ready to use. Remove the butter from the refrigerator and let stand at room temperature for about 10 minutes, until soft and pliable—the butter should yield gently when you press it with your finger and hold the indent, like a ripe avocado. On a lightly floured surface, using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out the dough to a 12-by-28-inch rectangle. If the dough springs back, cover it with a kitchen towel and let rest for 5 minutes before rolling. Arrange the butter in the center of the dough so the short sides are parallel. Fold over the 2 short sides of the dough so they meet in the center; pinch together to seal. Pinch the long sides of the dough together to completely seal in the butter. Turn the dough so that a long side is facing you and roll out to a 12-by-28-inch rectangle. Starting from the bottom, fold the dough into thirds like a letter. Brush off any excess flour and wrap the dough in plastic. Chill until firm but pliable, about 1 hour. Arrange the dough on a lightly floured surface with a short side facing you. Using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out the dough to a 12-by-28-inch rectangle. Fold into thirds like a letter, wrap in plastic and freeze overnight. Before baking, let thaw in the refrigerator until semi-firm and pliable, about 3 hours. Line 3 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. On a lightly floured surface, using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out the layered dough to a 13-by-36-inch rectangle. Using a pizza cutter or sharp knife, cut the dough crosswise to form nine 13-by-4-inch strips. Halve each strip lengthwise on the diagonal to make 18 long triangles. Starting at the shortest side, roll each triangle into a crescent shape. Arrange the croissants on the prepared sheets, tip side down and spaced 3 inches apart. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 400°. In a small bowl, beat the eggs with 1 tablespoon of water. Brush the croissants with the egg wash and bake until deep golden brown and crisp, 20 to 23 minutes. Transfer the croissants to a rack to cool.',\n",

       " {'instructions': '\\n\\nCroissant\\n\\n\\nWhat is a Croissant?\\nA croissant is a laminated, yeast-leavened bakery product that contains dough/roll-in fat layers to create a flaky, crispy texture. Croissants belong to the Viennoiserie or pastry category of baked goods along with brioche, Danish and puff pastries. A croissant usually contains normal levels of salt, yeast and sugar.1\\nThe texture and eating quality of croissants are created by lamination and expansion. The lamination process is the folding of dough to create alternating dough and fat layers while expansion is caused by the leavening action of yeast fermentation, and physical separation of the dough and fat layers during the oven spring stage of baking as the water trapped between them vaporizes to steam.1\\nOrigin\\nAs legend has it, the croissant was invented as a special roll in Vienna to celebrate the end of its invasion by Turkish troops from the Ottoman Empire in 1683. The enemy decided to attack at night to avoid being seen, but the Viennese bakers, who were working at the time, realized the city was under siege and alerted the authorities.\\nTo immortalize this victory, a baker with the name of Peter Windletter was selected to create the Hörnchen (“small horn” in German), with the shape of a crescent to symbolize the Ottoman flag and emblem. By eating this roll the people in Vienna celebrated symbolically their victory over their feared enemy. Marie-Antoinette d’Autriche, originally from Vienna, officially introduced and promoted the popularity of the croissant in France, starting in the late 1700s.1,2\\nHow are croissants made?\\nSimilar to brioche, croissant production follows the straight dough system. A typical croissant formula includes:1,3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIngredients\\nBaker’s %\\n\\n\\nBread flour (white)\\n100.0\\n\\n\\nLiquid milk (scalded and cooled) or water\\n58.0\\n\\n\\nYeast (osmotolerant instant dry)\\n1.5\\n\\n\\nSugar\\n6.0\\n\\n\\nSalt\\n2.2\\n\\n\\nFat (melted/softened butter)\\n10.0\\n\\n\\nTotal\\n177.7\\n\\n\\nButter or margarine for roll-in\\n25.0*\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*The standard quantity of roll-in fat for croissant is 25% based on total dough weight.\\nCommercial production\\nProducing high-quality croissants requires the following steps:1,3\\n\\nIngredients scaling/metering\\nMixing for 4–5 minutes at second speed setting to incorporate dry ingredients and obtain a smooth, not fully-developed gluten (full development takes place during rolling-in procedure). Dough temperature after mixing should be maintained in a narrow range 22–25°C (72–77°F).\\nFirst fermentation (45 minutes to 1 hour at room temperature)\\nPunching down of dough\\nResting in refrigerator or retarder for 30 minutes at 4°C (40°F)\\nDividing or cutting bulk dough to obtain rectangular pieces of desired weight\\nSheeting of dough with a roller pin or dedicated equipment\\nLaminating (sheeting and folding). Rolling in the fat using the English method followed by 3-fold. This method \\xa0results in 3 layers of dough separated by 2 layers of roll-in fat. By doing this, the dough is folded to form 54 separate layers (three three-folds).\\nRetarding/resting the dough in a refrigerator to allow the dough to relax for 30 minutes between each fold or series of folds. Dusting flour can be applied to the container or pan.\\nMake-up. In wholesale bakeries, croissants are shaped from pieces of laminated dough that have been sheeted to desired thickness and cut into a triangular shape. The dough is rolled starting from the base and given 3–4 turns or curls.\\nProofing for 90–120 minutes at 26°C (79°F), 75–80% RH. The proofing temperature should never exceed the melting point of the roll-in fat.\\nEgg washing\\nBaking for 10–20 minutes at 200°C (392°F). Shorter baking times are possible in high \\xa0temperature ovens.\\n\\nBaking high quality croissants\\n\\nApplication\\nIn laminated products, quality of the baked goods product depends heavily on the ability of water vapor to force apart the dough layers during baking. This creates a flakier product with superior eating quality, vital for consumers’ acceptability and market success. The objective of lamination is the creation of a large number of separate dough layers. The more individual layers created, the flakier the finished product will be.4\\nIt is important to maintain a relatively low temperature in the bakery (10–20°C or 50–68°F) in order to keep the roll-in fat plastic below its melting point so its pliable and not absorbed by the dough. Care should also be exercised to prevent the fat from becoming too firm at cold temperatures as this could cause handling issues. The temperature inside the plant can be controlled with a properly installed HVAC system.\\nThe key quality parameters when purchasing laminating fats is their melting point and temperature range of plasticity, i.e., essential for better workability of the dough at room temperature.\\nReferences\\n\\nSuas, M. “Viennoiserie” Advanced Bread and Pastry: A Professional Approach, first printing, Delmar, Cengage Learning, 2009, pp. 331–346.\\nCauvain, S. “Speciality Fermented Goods” Technology of Breadmaking, 3rd edition, Springer International Publishing Switzerland, 2015, pp. 253–277.\\nGisslen, W. “Rich Yeast Doughs” Professional Baking, 7th edition, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Hoboken, New Jersey, 2017, pp. 181–193.\\nCauvain, S. “Dough Retarding and Freezing” Technology of Breadmaking, 3rd edition, Springer International Publishing Switzerland, 2015, p. 204.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, combine the preferment and the remaining 2½ cups of flour, the remaining yeast, the milk, sugar, salt and softened butter. Mix until a dough comes together, then transfer to a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth, 2 minutes. On a parchment-lined sheet pan, shape the dough into a rectangle and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight. 3. The next day, laminate the dough: On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough into a 14-by-20-inch horizontal rectangle. 4. On a floured sheet of parchment paper, beat the 2½ sticks of unsalted butter with a rolling pin to flatten. Using flour as needed, roll the butter into a 9-by-13-inch rectangle. Peel off the parchment paper and place the butter insert on the right half of the dough. 5. Fold the dough over the butter and seal the edges. Fold the top third and bottom third of the dough in like a letter and place the folded dough, seal down, on a parchment-lined sheet pan. Chill for 30 minutes. 6. Roll the chilled dough into a 14-by-16-inch horizontal rectangle, then complete a trifold, folding the left and right ends in like a letter. Chill the dough for 30 minutes. Repeat this process 2 more times for a total of 4 trifolds, and then chill again for 30 minutes. 7. Roll the laminated dough into a 9-by-40-inch horizontal rectangle (this will take about 10 minutes). Using a sharp knife, cut 5-inch notches into the top edge of the rectangle. Begin to cut triangles, cutting to the centerpoint of each notch. You should end up with 14 triangles. 8. Working from the wide end of the triangle, roll the dough into a croissant shape, tucking the end of the dough underneath. Place the rolled croissants on 2 parchment-lined sheet pans, 2 inches apart. Lightly brush each one with some of the beaten egg, then place them somewhere warm to proof for 2 hours, until the croissants have risen and you can see the layers of butter. 9. Preheat the oven to 350º. After proofing, brush the croissants again with the remaining egg, then bake, rotating every 10 minutes, until golden brown and risen, 30 minutes. Let cool completely, then serve.',\n",

       " {'instructions': '\\n\\n\\nUn Panier\\xa0de Croissants..\\xa0A Basket of Croissants\\nWith Mother’s Day just around the corner Sydney and I have had numerous request to teach a class on Pâte à Croissants (Croissant dough). To be honest I was not ecstatic \\xa0at the thought of conducting a culinary class on croissants without having taught a beginner bread and pastry class. Pains\\xa0sucré\\xa0or sweet bread dough has caused calm sane people to revert to a two year old having a tantrum. However a good friend of Sydney’s wanted to learn the method and technique to prepare croissants for a Mother’s day brunch she was hosting; her mother had just finished a long painful battle with breast cancer and this is going to be their first Mother’s Day without chemotherapy. I could not in good conscience refuse.\\n\\n\\nYou can almost smell the buttery goodness!\\nSydney and I decided six students would have to be the limit, three students per instructor seemed appropriate. In theory the recipe has few ingredients yeast (fresh or active dry), flour, liquid, sugar and salt. As I mentioned prior jumping into creating flaky light buttery croissants without any previous knowledge of yeast breads seemed a recipe for disaster. Sydney and I began brainstorming a successful, flourishing, and enjoyable pains (bread) class. Since croissants can take a minimum of 12 hours to a maximum of 3 days,depending how the method used, we concluded it would be advantageous instead of only teaching croissants to teach a\\xa0pâte feuilletée  (puff pastry), pâte à brioche (brioche), and pâte à croissant (croissant) class over a 5 day period.\\nCroissants are, in my opinion, across between pâte à brioche and pâte feuilletée. Both puff pastry and croissants need the détrempe and barrage at the same temperature, , rest in the refrigerator between rolls, and use the same method of rolling, folding, and turning. Brioche and croissants each use yeast to rise the dough, and need to be proofed more than once.\\n\\n\\nAfter we completed a schedule for the week, we were ready for our group of students, the only prerequisite I asked was each student needed to have an understanding of yeast breads. We prepared six\\xa0\\xa0syllabuses, recipes for the puff pastry, brioche, and croissant, and each student received a mini food processor. When Monday arrived we were ready and motivated.\\nSince my intention is not to bore you with the details of the entire week from here on I will only be referring to the croissant portion. I must admit, for most part, the class went rather smoothly and all had a tremendous time. I will start with same line I said as we began the croissant portion, “please take a deep breath and release slowly.” If you are confident the dough will be submissive to you.\\nPrior to beginning anything prepare your mise en place\\n\\nWe used fresh compressed yeast (also called cake yeast), but active drive yeast works fine and I have given both versions.\\n\\nPâte à Croissant Dough 11:\\n\\n244 grams/ 1-cup whole milk, warm about 35 degrees C/ 95 degrees F\\n110 grams/1/2-cup heavy cream, warm about 35 degrees F/ 95 degrees F\\n29.9 grams/ 1.3 ounces fresh yeast or 13 grams dry yeast/ 1 Tablespoon, plus ¼ -teaspoon\\n4 grams/ 1- teaspoon sugar\\n18 grams/1 Tablespoon salt\\n50 grams/ ¼-cups brown sugar, granulated white sugar may be subsituted\\n480 to 540 gram/ 4 -4½ -cups T-45 or all- purpose flour, reserve 60 grams/ 1/2 cup\\n340 grams butter, cold\\n25 grams/ 2-Tablespoons flour\\n\\nPrepare your mise en place. In a small bowl whisk the flour and set aside covered.\\n\\nDétrempe:\\nIf using dry yeast: proof the yeast with the 110grams/ 1/2 cup warm cream, 4 grams/ 1-teaspoon sugar, and yeast. Adding the yeast to the warm cream and then the sugar allowing it to sit for about 7 minutes.\\nIf using fresh yeast:\\na. Dissolve 1 teaspoon sugar in 11o grams/ 1/2 cup cream, warmed \\xa0to 90°F – 95°F\\nb. Add crumbled Cake Yeast to sugar solution.\\nc. Stir yeast until completely dissolved.\\nd. Let mixture stand until yeast begins to foam vigorously (5 – 10 minutes).\\ne. Add mixture to remaining ingredients.\\nEither yeasts will look the same once foaming\\n\\nIn the bowl of a standing mixer add the yeast mixture, 480 grams of flour (reserving 60 grams/ 1/2-cup flour if needed), and the brown sugar whisk together, by hand, and then whisk in salt.\\nUsing your dough hook on low speed add the warm milk until the dry ingredients are moistened. Raise the speed to medium (#4) and amalgamate for about 4 minutes. The dough should be silky, smooth, pulled away from the sides of the bowl, and will still cling to your fingers slightly.\\nPlace the dough in a 4-quart bowl 0r dough bucket that has been lightly greased with butter or cooking spray. \\xa0Cover the bowl with the lid or \\xa0plastic wrap. Place the dough in \\xa0room temperature room (26 degrees C/80 degrees F ) for 30 minutes. If the room is colder preheat your oven to 150, turn it off, and the oven should \\xa0register at 26 degrees C/ 80 degrees F. Place the dough in the oven.\\nUsing a greased rubber spatula, gently fold the dough.\\nCover and place in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours to 8 hours.\\nThe Beurrage:\\nCube the butter into dice size pieces. I found the best way to combine the butter with the flour, is to place the cold cube butter and 25 grams of flour in the bowl of your standing mixer on low speed, with the paddle attachment, mix the butter and flour. \\xa0Once the mixture is amalgamated shape into a 28cm x 28cm 9×9-inche square (no thicker than 3/8 of inch). The butter should still be cool but workable- about 16 degrees C/ 60 degrees F.\\nUse it right away, the temperature must be at 16 C/ 60F to laminate properly.\\n\\nPâton:\\n**Laminate the dough\\nTake the dough from the refrigerator and roll out to 31 x 31 cm/ 12.5 x 12.5 –inches. Place the barrage (butter square) diagonally in the center of détrempe (dough) using the back of knife mark the dough at the corners of the butter, remover the butter at form flaps where the marks are. Roll the flaps a little. Now moisten the flaps slightly place the butter back into the center, diagonally. Wrap the butter by securely overlapping the flaps slightly. Wrap the pâton in plastic film and allow it to rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes, but no longer.\\n** The laminating method is one Rose Levy Beranbaum uses, I believe it works best.\\nTurning the Détrempe:\\nFirst Turn: \\nPlace the dough seems side up on a floured marble board. Keep your work surface lightly floured, gently roll the pâton into a long rectangle about 50 cm/20 inches long by 18 cm/ 7inches wide. Brush off the flour from the dough’s surface and give it a business letter fold (folding into thirds). Wrap the folded dough in plastic film, lay on a parchment paper lined ½ baking sheet, and allow it to rest in the refrigerator for 40 minutes. Mark the paper to keep track of the turns. I generally like to complete a total of 6 turns, but a minimum of 4 turns is fine. The dough will let you know!\\n\\nSecond turn through four or \\xa0sixth turns: (you may do up to six turns if the dough allows)\\nStart with a clean work surface that has been lightly floured. Position the dough so that the spine is faced to your left (like a book) and press down the edges of the dough with a rolling pin to keep them straight. (The upper part tends to roll out more than the bottom part). Roll and fold the détrempe the exact same way, but turn it over occasionally to keep the seams and edges even. Be sure to roll into all four corners of the détrempe, and use a pastry scraper to even the edges. A total of four turns should be completed; the third turn can have a double fold equaling four turns.\\n\\n**The Portefeuille (wallet) Fold (only if you decide not to do four to six turns)\\nStart again with a 27cm/11 inch side running from your left side to your right. Roll the dough into a rectangle 40 t0 42cm to 25 to 27cm/ x 16 to 18-inch inches long by about 10 to 12-incheswide. Fold the left and right sides of the dough into the center, leaving a little space in the center, and then fold one side over the other as though you were closing a book. This is the famous double turn, also known as “le portefeuille (the wallet”).\\nThe Portefeuille should be chilled for 2 hours.\\n** This is a method used by professionals.\\nShaping the croissants:\\nTo Shape the Croissants:\\nBegin with a cleaned flour workspace\\nRoll out the dough to 60 cm/24-inchs by 43cm/ 17-inches.\\n\\nBrush off all the flour. Fold the dough lengthwise so it ‘s 15cm/6-inche/ by 56cm/22-inches. Using a croissant cutter cut across the long side. Brush off all the flour. Fold the dough over lengthwise.\\nDamp a cloth to keep your hands moisten while stretching the triangles.\\nUsing a croissant cutter (or a pizza cutter) begin to cut, if using a pizza cutter cut a triangle) cut through both layer all the way to the other side. Open the folded triangles, so for every full cut there are two triangles formed.\\n\\nShape one triangle at a time, keeping the remaining triangles covered with plastic wrap.\\nUse the scrapes of dough to place in the top of triangle, keep them covered as well.\\n\\nForming the Croissant:\\n1.Cut the triangle.\\n2.Unfold the triangle carefully, cut along the fold to separate.\\n3.Gently stretch the triangle twice it’s original length about 23 cm/ 9-inches long.\\n4.Enclose a piece of scrape dough to pump up the middle.\\n5.With the point facing you roll the dough towards you, gently moving your hand down out to the side.\\n6.Curve the pointed ends of the rolled croissant to form the traditional shape.\\n\\nTo Shape the Croissants:\\nBegin with a cleaned flour workspace; roll the dough to 35.5 by 61 cm/14 by 24 inches.\\n\\nGently stretch each triangle about 9-inches long; first pull the base sideways- gently, but with a firm hand-then holding the base in your left hand, use your thumb and two fingers of your right hand to work down the length, elongating it. Place the triangle on your work surface with the narrow point facing you. Grab a ball scrape, shape into a football shape, and place the wide base of the triangle. Roll the base over one of the football of scrape dough to encase it about ½ inch. Continue rolling with the fingers of your left hand, keeping the triangle stretched with your right hand. Place the croissant on silpat lined ventilated sheet pan with the point underneath. Curve the sides so that they turn in on the side of the croissant facing you. Keep the croissant covered with plastic wrap while you shape the rest. Set about 6 to7 rolled croissants, evenly spaced, about 2 inches apart giving them room to grow.\\n\\nPlace the baking sheet of croissants in a warm place to rise, ideally about 26 degrees C/ 80 degrees F for about 2 hours or until the croissants have doubled in size and have achieved a light texture.\\n\\nEgg Wash Glaze:\\n50 grams/1 whole egg\\n14 grams/ 1-tablespoon heavy cream, half and half, milk or water\\nSugar for sprinkling, optional\\n\\nBaking the Croissants:\\n\\nPreheat the oven to 218 to 232 degrees C/ 425 degrees F, arrange the oven racks so one rack to the lower and upper positions. Prepare egg wash and very lightly with a pastry brush, brush the egg wash onto the croissants.\\n\\nOpen the oven, spritz the oven generously with spray bottle of water and quickly close the door. Open the oven door again, slide the croissant sheets into oven and re spritz. Turn down the oven temperature to 240 degrees C/ 400 degrees F. after about 10 minutes rotate the croissant sheets. Reduce the oven temperature to 191 degrees C/ 375 degrees F and continue to bake the croissants till deep golden brown, internal temperature should register at 99 degrees C/ 210 degrees F. (about 8 more minutes). They will finish baking while they cool.\\n\\nCooling the Croissant:\\nOnce the croissants have achieved the color and correct internal temperature, remove from the oven and transfer to a cooling rack for about 20 to 30 minutes.\\n\\nSince Mother’s Day is still 2 weeks away I cannot tell if Sydney’s friend created light flaky croissants for her brunch, but now she knows how!\\nVoila!\\n\\n\\n\\n ',\n",

Well… sometimes a girl’s gotta do what a girl’s gotta do! This post has affiliate links that earn me a small commission if you make any purchases.Here’s how my life works: Sunday night I see a post on Facebook that Monday is National Croissant Day. I get excited and decide I want the best chocolate croissant available locally. Then I realize I don’t know where to get one…After asking for recommendations I realize that I can go to a somewhat obnoxiously expensive local bakery or I can try the Trader Joe’s frozen chocolate croissants that multiple friends assure me are amazingly good.The problem? This all happened at about 10pm Sunday. Trader Joe’s is closed, which means I can’t buy those frozen croissants until Monday morning, the day of the croissant “holiday” I need to celebrate. The instructions note that you have to proof them overnight before baking. Until I invent that way back machine, I don’t have those nine hours to wait.I tried googling to determine whether I could proof frozen chocolate croissants in my oven and – if so – how to proof frozen croissants. I came up with nothing. Fortunately, the four pack of Trader Joe’s frozen chocolate croissants are $4.49 at my local store. If I fail, it isn’t a huge waste – and I still have that expensive local bakery I can visit.I’ll admit, when I first looked at the frozen croissant, I had my doubts. This doesn’t resemble any croissant I’ve ever enjoyed.Wait, what’s proofing?When you bake with yeast, you need to proof your dough. That means it needs to rise prior to baking. Did you know that when you’re making these frozen croissants, you’re baking with yeast?It is not a step you can skip. If you put a frozen croissant into the oven and baked it, it would not rise as well or nicely as you want. You’d end up with a dense croissant, which is where proofing comes in. The amount of time it takes to proof dough varies based on the temperature of the dough and of your environment. In a cold house, it’ll take longer to proof than in the middle of summer.How to Proof Frozen Croissants in Your OvenThe instructions state to leave them out overnight to proof for nine hours. Well, I found you can speed that up. I’ve used my oven to proof dough before when baking bread that I wanted to finish faster.The challenge with croissants is that part of what makes croissants that light, flaky pastry is the layer after layer of butter in the dough. If I proof the frozen croissants, I risk melting that butter and losing flaky layers. Hello, balancing act!If your oven has a proofing setting, you’re golden. If your oven doesn’t have a proofing setting, it’s harder but still doable.With the proofing setting, turn your oven to proofing and set it to 90 degrees for 110 minutes. Place your croissants in the oven seam side down on a silpat covered baking sheet. Let it proof in the oven. Once your timer goes off just under 2 hours, remove the croissant(s) from the oven. You may notice a little bit of butter just starting to melt out, but that’s fine.If you have no proofing setting, preheat your oven to the lowest possible temperature. If you have space, I highly recommend a countertop oven for quick dinners and specialty applications like this! Once it reaches that temperature, turn off your oven and open the door for 30 seconds to a minute. Place your croissants in the oven and shut the door. Turn on the light inside your oven to give it a little extra heat. Start checking your croissants at the two hour mark to see if they’ve proofed properly. It may take up to three hours with this method, depending on how well insulated your oven is.Baking Your Frozen CroissantsRegardless of the method you used to proof frozen croissants, once they’ve risen, remove the baking sheet with your croissants from the oven. Place your tray on the counter and preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Return the croissant(s) to the oven and bake for 22 minutes, until golden brown.The hard part now is waiting for the croissant to cool enough to enjoy. Remember, you just heated that chocolate in a 350 degree oven. Let it cool 5 minutes so\\xa0you don’t burn yourself!I may not have had fresh chocolate croissants first thing in the morning, but I didn’t have to wait anywhere near the nine hours (plus baking time!) prescribed in the instructions.If you wake up early, you can still enjoy these for breakfast. If you’re like me, enjoy your sleep because they make a great mid morning brunch. This was so good, I sacrificed and made another one just to test my theories and to write this post. You’re welcome.Now go enjoy that croissant because you know you can proof frozen croissants in your oven when you have a croissant emergency! Do you see all those gorgeous flaky layers?

Stir in the flour and yeast and mix until well incorporated. The mixture should be thick and slightly difficult to mix.\\nSet aside for 30 minutes. The poolish will expand. It should triple or even quadruple in size, and become spongy with bubbles forming at the top.\\xa0Photos below: Before and After.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nStep 2 – Make the dough.\\nMeanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, salt and sugar.\\xa0\\nAdd the poolish (make sure you scrape the saucepan to get all the poolish into the dough) and the milk. Stir to combine.\\nKnead in the cubes of butter in three separate additions. Make sure the butter is well incorporated before you incorporate the next addition.\\xa0\\nKnead the dough for 5-6 minutes (in the bowl or you can transfer it to a working surface). The dough should be soft, smooth and slightly sticky. Do not over-knead. The dough shouldn’t be too firm nor elastic.\\nCover a 8x8-inch (20.3cmx20.3cm) or 9x9-inch (22.9cmx22.9cm) square pan with plastic film and pat the dough into it. Cover with plastic film and refrigerate\\xa0overnight.\\xa0\\n\\nStep 3 – Prepare the butter\\nIn the meantime, take the butter out of the fridge and cut it into about ½-inch (1.25cm) thick square slices (if using a block of butter – not sticks - this will give you 4 slices).\\nLay a large piece of parchment paper on a working surface. Place the slices of butter flat on the paper to form a 5x5-inches (12.7cmx12.7cm) square.\\n\\nLay another piece of parchment paper on top. With a rolling pin, roll out the butter to a large 6.5x6.5-inch (16.5cmx16.5cm) square. Peel off the parchment paper, wrap the butter slab in plastic film and chill overnight as well.\\xa0\\n\\nStep 4 – Laminate the dough\\nThe next day (afternoon), take the dough out of the fridge. Take it out of the square pan, unwrap it and place it onto a large, lightly floured working surface (ideally, cold marble top / Do not flour it too much or the dough will absorb too much flour and become too stiff.)\\n\\nStep 4.1 - Roll out the dough into a 12X12-inch (30.5cmx30.5cm) square – make sure it is even in thickness. Take the butter out of the fridge and place it in the middle of the square at a 45 degree angle. Fold a corner side of the dough over the butter, with the tip of the corner in the middle of the butter (corner side should be triangle-shaped, since the butter is 45 degree diagonal). Repeat with the other other corner sides of the dough, so they all overlap in the center and the butter is totally encased within the dough.\\n  \\nStep 4.2 - Lightly flour your rolling pin and carefully start to roll out the dough (with the butter inside) to a 8x24-inch (20.3cmx61cm) rectangle. Be very gentle when you roll the dough out: apply even pressure and work your way slowly (you don’t want to break the butter into pieces nor squeeze it to the sides – it has to stay enclosed within the dough). Keep it mind that 8-inches (20.3cm) isn’t very wide, so focus on lenghtening the dough to 24-inches (61cm), rolling back and forth, rather then widening it.\\nOnce the dough has reached its intended rectangular size (8x24-inches/20.3cmx61cm rectangle), fold it like a letter lenghtwise (one side on top of the other). Wrap in plastic film and chill for 30 minutes.\\n \\nAfter 30 minutes, take the dough out of the fridge and place it onto the working surface with the “open side” facing you (rotate 90 degrees; see photo right below). Repeat Step 4.2 (rolling to a 8x24-inch (20.3cmx61cm) rectangle and folding) and chill again for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, repeat Step 4.2 one last time, starting again with the open side facing you, and chill for 30 minutes. In total, you complete Step 4.2 three times.\\n\\nStep 5 – Cutting the dough \\nAfter 30 minutes, take the dough out of the fridge and place it onto the working surface with the “open side” facing you again and roll it out to a 8x43.3-inch (20.3cmx110cm) long rectangle. The dough will resist a bit (this is normal). When the dough is its intented size, make sure it isn’t stuck to the working surface by lifting it gently (it will shrink a bit naturally).\\n\\nWorking along the long side of the rectangle, make small cuts in the dough at 5 inch (12.5cm) intervals (you get 7 cuts in total). Working along the other long side of the rectangle, make small cuts at 5 inches (12.5cm) intervals, but starting at 2.5 inches (6.25cm) from the top of the rectangle, so these cuts don’t align with the ones on the other side – this will form the basis of triangles.\\nUse the pizza cutter and a ruler (or straight object) to make diagonal cuts (joining the top and bottom small cut marks), to create triangular cuts along the length of the dough. Discard of the two end pieces.\\n\\nStep 6 – Shaping the croissants \\nUsing a sharp knife or your pizza cutter, mark a small ½ inch (2.5cm) cut in the center of the short side of each triangle.\\n\\nGrab the shorter side, stretch it out slightly and roll it up toward the pointy end.\\xa0\\nOnce all rolled up, press gently onto the pointy end to seal the croissant.\\nTake both ends of the rolled up croissants and slightly bend them to create a crescent shape.\\xa0\\n \\nStep 7 – Proofing \\nCarefully lift each croissant and arrange them in parchment lined airtight containers, leaving enough space between them to expand. Close with a lid, and refrigerate overnight.\\n\\nThe next morning, transfer the chilled croissants on parchment lined baking sheets, (6 croissants/sheet), leaving enough space between them to expand.\\nWhisk the egg with the milk and brush a first generous coat of egg wash onto the croissants.\\nProof the croissants for 1 hour\\xa0in a draft-free environment (make sure you read the steps to proofing here).\\xa0\\nPre-heat your oven to 390°F (199 °C).\\nWhen the oven is pre-heated, brush a second coat of egg wash on the croissants.\\n\\nStep 8 – Baking\\nBake for 9 minutes. When the croissants start to become golden, turn the heat down to 370 F(188 °C) and bake for 7 minutes (1 or 2 minutes more/less depending on your oven).\\nTake the croissants out of the oven. Leave on the baking sheet for 2 minutes, and gently transfer them onto a cooling rack.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you try this Three Day Classic French Croissants recipe,\\xa0let me know!\\xa0 Leave a comment or share a photo on Instagram tagging\\xa0@pardonyourfrench\\xa0or using\\xa0#pardonyourfrench.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nYou might also want to try:\\xa0\\n\\nOne Day Classic French Croissants\\nTwo Day Classic French Croissants\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbakerybutterclassic frenchcroissants \\n\\n\\nThis three-day version of my Classic French Croissant is the real deal! There are no shortcuts, but you will achieve the closest thing to real French Bakery Croissants (if not the same). The three days necessary for the process offers the proper time for the dough to develop, relax and build a rich complexity in taste and texture. A great weekend project, worth every effort and minute!\\nIn comparison to my One-day or Two-day Classic French Croissants recipe, these will have the flakiest outside, most aerated crumb and have the most subtle yet complex buttery taste.\\n\\n\\n\\nSparing three days on a recipe can seem intimidating or even overwhelming, but this recipe only truly requires 2 to 2 hours ½ of your active time (depending on how comfortable you are with the technique). After completing this recipe once, you will be much more at ease with the process and can more naturally fit this recipe within your weekend schedule.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore you start this recipe, make sure to read this post: Classic French Croissants 101 Guide, where I am covering all the essentials you need to know before making croissants for the first time (choice of ingredients, yeast, poolish, laminating, proofing, etc…).\\xa0\\nSummary of the timeline:\\xa0\\n(ie. Start Friday evening, and get freshly-baked croissants for Sunday morning)\\nDay 1: In the Evening (30 minutes active time, total) \\nMake the poolish and dough. Refrigerate until Day 2.\\xa0\\nDay 2: Late Afternoon/ Evening (2 hours 30 minutes total, inc. 1 hour 30 minutes of chill time) \\nLaminate the dough and shape the croissants. Refrigerate until Day 3.\\nDay 3: Morning (1 hour of proofing and 17 minutes of baking)\\nProofing and baking of the croissants\\nTotal: 4 hours, over 3 days\\n\\n\\n\\nThe equipment\\n\\nStand Mixer (optional – easier for kneading the dough; but this can be done by hand too)\\nLarge working surface (ideally, cold marble top)\\nRolling pin\\nRuler or measuring tape (cm or inch)\\nPizza cutter\\nPastry Brush\\nTwo baking sheets; parchment paper\\nPlastic film\\n\\xa08×8-inch (20.3×20.3cm) or 9×9-inch (22.9×22.9cm) square pan\\n2 large air-tight containers (able to contain 6 croissants each).\\n\\nImportant note: Making Classic French Croissants is an intermediate to advanced level recipe. It took me several years to get a hang of “laminating” and “proofing”, having several failures along the way. I can’t promise your very first batch of croissants will be a success (mine definitely weren’t). But if you persevere, you will succeed!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThree Day Classic French Croissants\\nAudrey\\nThis three-day version of my Classic French Croissant is the real deal!
