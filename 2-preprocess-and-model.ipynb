       "'The preparation of the croissants consists of two main phases: the initial dough, called détrempe, and the laminating, which consists of integrating the butter to the détrempe, forming alternate layers.\\nThe difficulty in making croissants at home lies in manually creating thin and even layers of dough/butter in order to achieve a product with good volume and an open, honey-comb texture.\\n\\nTools\\nFor making the dough and shaping the butter:\\n\\nClingfilm and freezer bag. It is important to correctly wrap the détrempe (and then the dough) in clingfilm and then put it inside a freezer bag to prevent it from drying out. It will also protect the dough against possible unpleasant smells inside the refrigerator.\\nWaxed paper, pencil and ruler. To give butter the right shape in order to work with precision.\\n\\nFor laminating:\\n\\nCold tray. Before rolling, place a tray (better if steel or marble) inside the freezer so you can place in it croissants once cut and keep them cold before shaping.\\nIce blocks. To keep the work surface cool at all times.\\nRolling pin. I use a stainless steel rolling pin because it has several advantages: it is non-stick and it’s heavy, so it saves me effort when handling some doughs. However, its weight can also be a disadvantage, especially if you have no experience in laminating. In fact, when we have no experience we usually tend to apply too much pressure on the rolling pin during laminating. So if we use a heavy rolling pin like the stainless steel one we may break the layers. Therefore, I do not recommend that you specifically buy this kind of rolling pin. If you already have it, it’s great but if not, a standard wooden rolling pin is perfectly fine. Once you have more experience in laminating, the stainless rolling pin is quite useful.\\nBrush. The brush will allow us to remove the excess flour without damaging the dough.\\nInfrared thermometer. It’s a necessary tool to control the temperature of the dough at all times. It’s cheap and very practical.\\nSharp knife or pizza steel. To trim the edges of the dough during laminating, and to precisely divide the croissants before shaping them.\\n\\n\\nImportant notes on the ingredients\\n1. What flour should we use to make croissants?\\nChoosing the right flour is very important to get croissants with the right volume and texture. As you can imagine, not all flours can be used. When choosing the flour, you have to check some technical data: baking strength, elasticity/tenacity ratio (P/L) and the protein percentage.\\n– Baking strength: choose a strong flour, which allows to develop gluten during kneading, but also during rolling. The strength of the flour is measured by the W factor. A strong flour has a factor that ranges between W320 and W380.\\n– P/L: the flour you choose not only has to be strong, but it has to maintain this strength over time, that is, during proofing and baking. The factor that determines the relationship between force and time is called «P/L» (i.e., elasticity & tenacity). The flour used for croissant should have a good P/L ratio to avoid the dough fighting back during laminating (between 0.4 and 0.7 approx., the higher this value is, the less elasticity the flour presents).\\n– Proteins: the percentage of proteins (i.e. gluten) goes hand in hand with the baking strength. The more strength, the more protein. It is very important that the flour you use is rich in proteins (between 13% and 15%), since the good development of the croissants depends to a large extent on it.\\nTo these three factors, I would add the water absorption power of the flour. It is difficult to measure it and you will have to try it by yourself. The hydration rate of the détrempe will depend on this factor (a flour that has a high water absorption power will need more hydration).\\nI usually use two flours that meet these characteristics: Lievitati flour (W350-370 – P / L 0.48 / 0.50 – Proteins> 13%) and flour Sfoglia (W300-320 – P / L 0.48 / 0.50 – Proteins> 13%), both from Molino Pasini. Like most specific flours they are not easy to find in regular stores and are usually sold in bags of 10 or 25 kg. Some of these flours are available online.\\n\\n2. Yeast, sourdough, preferment: which is the best way to ferment the croissants?\\nCroissants can be fermented using various methods, the three main ones being: yeast (direct method), a mix of preferment (poolish) and yeast, or a combination of sourdough and yeast.\\nSourdough\\nIf you do not have experience making croissants at home, I would not recommend to start using sourdough. Besides adding complexity to the process (a more precise organization and a greater control of the proofing phase), its use requires a fairly rigorous control of the sourness, especially if, like me, you do not use your sourdough daily and it stays weeks in the fridge. If the breads we bake can have a mildly sour taste, croissants cannot so we have to make sure that the sourdough we use to make croissants is not sour at all.\\nAfter many tests, I think it’s not that worth to use sourdough in the croissant formula. When I started making croissants at home, I used part of sourdough (30%) and a small amount of dry yeast (since making decent croissants using only sourdough is almost impossible, even for professional bakers), but it did not end to achieve the expected results with this combination: my croissants lacked a little volume and I didn’t get the texture I expected.\\nThere is a certain obsession with sourdough among home bakers (including myself!). The use of sourdough is essential for many breads, as it provides a special texture and helps extending the lifespan of the product (as in the case of Panettone, for example). However, a croissant is prepared for immediate consumption and, in this case, sourdough barely provides benefits in terms of texture and flavor. Of course you get great croissants using a part of sourdough (and as a personal challenge it’s fine!) but I personally achieved better results using fresh yeast.\\nPreferment\\nSome bakers (like Chad Roberston from Tartine), use poolish in their formula, a liquid preferment made with the same proportion of flour and water, and with a pinch of yeast (between 0.1% and 0,3%). It is usually prepared on the eve so that it ferments between 8 and 16 hours, and bakers usually use between 30% and 40% over the total weight of the flour of the détrempe.\\nIn theory, poolish allows to achieve a greater extensibility of the détrempe, which helps to better laminate the dough. Personally, I do not like this method as I think it brings more moisture to the dough, which forces us to have more control over hydration.\\nSome bakers also add a proportion of pâte fermentée («fermented dough», that is to say of previous détrempe) or even cuts of croissant dough in order to fully develop the croissant aromas; however I do not recommend it because it alters the formula (increasing the proportion of all ingredients, including yeast) and, consequently, proofing times.\\nDry yeast or fresh yeast?\\nThe best option for me (at least to begin with) is to use yeast.\\nI have tried both types of yeast (fresh and dry). At first I used dry yeast. However, I have stopped using it for several reasons. Firstly because it contains additives. Secondly because fermentation is slower and more difficult to control. And finally, I find it difficult to check the quality and condition of the dry yeast, since some of it has been packed for a long time and lose a lot of strength.\\nIn my opinion, the best option for making homemade croissants is to use only fresh yeast. It is easy to find and its use is very practical.\\nSome advices when using fresh yeast.\\nI buy it from one of the bakeries in my neighborhood. They sell it to the weight and they usually receive it daily so I know it is very fresh and of great quality. But you can use perfectly the one sold in supermarkets.\\n– Look carefully at the expiration date. Before using it, smell it: if it smells very strong or rancid throw it away.\\n– Do not freeze it: the bacteria it contains will end up dying.\\n– Keep it wrapped in cling film inside a tightly closed glass jar to prevent it from drying out and consume it quickly.\\n3. Why is sugar important in fermented doughs?\\nIn addition to providing flavor and color (favoring caramelization), sugar is part of the food for yeast. Bear in mind that during proofing, yeast consumes part of the sugars. The other part stays in the dough. Therefore, if we do not add sugar or use too little, our croissants will not ferment properly and will lose color and texture. Also keep in mind that sugar absorbs part of the moisture of the dough, so you have to adjust the amount of water depending on the amount of sugar.\\nCroissants usually carry between 8% and 15% sugar. You can use different kinds of sugars such as panela, coconut sugar, brown sugar, etc., taking into account that they will provide a different color and flavor to the final product. However, it is not advisable to use sweeteners (both liquid and granulated), since they have a greater sweetening power which would modify the texture and flavor.\\n4. Is it better to use water or milk?\\nAt first I only used water (and a very small amount of milk powder). However, according to several pro bakers, milk not only adds flavor but has an influence on elasticity during kneading (that is, during the formation of gluten). I usually use half water half semi-skim milk, and I find it a good balance between flavor and texture.\\nRegarding water, it’s better to use filtered water or spring water. If you use tap water, leave it a couple of hours inside a glass so that chlorine can evaporate.\\n5. Is it necessary to use eggs in the croissants dough?\\nAlthough some recipes add egg, croissant dough does NOT carry egg. Other similar doughs, such as the Danish pastry, do carry it. Egg would provide a rather “brioche” texture, but in the case of croissants we are looking for a drier and lighter texture.\\n6. Is it essential to add salt?\\nYes, especially in fermented doughs. First of all because it strengthens the gluten and increases the absorption of water. And secondly because it slows down the activity of the yeast. In the case of croissants, we do not want the dough to ferment during the whole process; salt helps us to slown down fermentation.\\n7. What is malted barley flour for?\\nI use malted barley flour in many of my breads not only to enhance the flavor, but also to improve the crust. I love the touch it gives to croissants, but it is a very personal criterion and its use is completely optional. You can find it in specialized stores and in organic food shops.\\n8. What is the best butter for laminating?\\nButter is the characteristic flavor of a good croissant. That is why it is very important to choose a good quality butter. Professionals often use special «dry» butter specific for puff pastry, which percentage of fat is 84% (2% more than standard butter) and whose melting point (i.e. the point at which the butter begins to melt) is higher (34 ºC while that of standard butter is 28ºC). These characteristics facilitate the work of professional bakers by providing them with a butter that is easier to work with, with a lower degree of humidity and that withstands the high temperatures of the bakeries.\\nHowever, they are not easy to get and are often reserved to professional bakers. While it is true that this type of butter is ideal for making croissants and that its flavor is incomparable, it is not worth buying it. I have tried several butters of different brands and I can assure you that you can get great results using a butter of good quality from the supermarket. I usually use organic French butter (from Président). You will have to try until you find the one you like the most.\\nOf course, forget about shortening or low-fat products.\\n\\nHow to make croissant dough\\nAlthough there are many croissant recipes available, there are few variations from one to the other. After all, croissants almost always have the same ingredients, only the proportions vary. At the beginning it is normal to follow strictly the available formulas. But there is no perfect formula, especially because each of us uses different ingredients in different places. Using the same formula we would obtain different results depending on the type of flour we have and depending on the place we live (it is not the same to make croissants in Madrid, where the climate is very dry, than in the North of Spain, very rainy and humid).\\nThe success of a recipe depends not only on the ingredients and the steps to follow, but also on other factors more complex to control such as the ambient temperature, the degree of humidity, the temperature of the dough after kneading, the power of the oven, etc. That is why it’s important to investigate, to try different flours and butters and to modify the quantities according to our needs, but also to be very methodical in all the phases of the process, i.e. to control the temperature of the dough and the proofing times, to let the dough rest between the folds, etc. Only then we will achieve a final product according to our requirements.\\nThe formula that I propose below is nothing exceptional: I have been testing and adapting different recipes of great pastry chefs (Thomas Marie, Pierrick Challamel, Philippe Conticini, Daniel Alvarez, among others) to find a formula adapted to my needs.\\n\\nIngredients\\nFor the croissant initial dough (détrempe)\\n300 g strong flour (Lievitati from Molino Pasini) (100%)\\n80 g cold water (26.6%)\\n79 g cold semi-skimmed milk (26.4%)\\n45 g sugar (15%)\\n30 g unsalted butter (softened) (10%)\\n6 g salt (2%)\\n9 g fresh yeast (3%)\\n2 g malted barley (0.6%)\\nFor laminating\\n171 g butter (31% of the total détrempe weight)\\nOrganization\\nDay 1 (Saturday)\\n– 7:00 pm: make the détrempe and chill it in the freezer.\\n– 7.30 pm: prepare the butter block and keep it in the fridge overnight.\\n– 8.30 pm: remove the détrempe from the freezer and store it in the fridge overnight.\\nDay 2 (Sunday)\\n– 8.00 am: start laminating, first fold.\\n– 9.00 am: second fold\\n– 10.00 am: third fold\\n– 11.30 am: cut and shape the croissants and let them ferment\\n– 2.30-3.00 pm: bake the croissants\\nDAY 1 – SATURDAY\\n7.00 pm – Détrempe (initial dough)\\nPlace all ingredients, except the butter, into the bowl of the stand mixer and knead about 4 minutes at minimum speed.\\nI insist on the fact that the liquids have to be very cold to prevent the dough from overheating and begin to ferment during kneading. The temperature of the dough at the end of the kneading phase should not exceed 22 degrees C.\\nOn the other hand, you may have to adjust the hydration percentage depending on the water absorption capacity of your flour, taking into account that the more hydrated is the dough, the harder it’ll be to get an open crumb (however the dough will be easier to laminate). After 4 minutes, add the softened butter and continue kneading 3 or 4 minutes at the same speed.\\nWe have to develop the gluten so that the dough supports the later phase of integration of the butter, but not 100%, since we will continue to develop gluten during laminating. A kneading between 8 and 10 minutes is usually enough, although everything will depend on the flour your use and on the power & type of your stand mixer. Strong flours require a soft and slow kneading to avoid giving too much tension to the dough. We do not want too much gluten development because we will struggle extending the dough during laminating. The final dough has to have a smooth texture and with some elasticity (but not too much), and does not have to stick to your hands or the work surface.\\nWhen the dough is ready, shape it as a disc with the palm of your hand so it can cool faster, wrap it well in plastic wrap and place it inside a freezer bag. Put the dough in the freezer so that it cools quickly, without it becoming frozen (between an hour and an hour and a half depending on the temperature of your freezer).\\n[Note: all videos have English subtitles. You can turn them on by clicking the Settings wheel in the lower part of the screen.]\\n\\nSome formulas state that it’s possible to completely freeze the détrempe for a later use. I do not recommend it since the yeast weakens and even dies depending on the freezing time. It is better to give it a cold snap and keep it in the refrigerator (in the coldest part) until the next day.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Important note regarding the temperature of the détrempe\\nDon’t forget that we do not want the détrempe fo ferment before laminating. We want it to rest in the cold so that it relaxes and can be extended more easily. The experts say that to avoid the dough to start fermenting, the temperature has to be less than 6 ºC. However, the temperature of our refrigerators is usually much higher, although it indicates otherwise. Ideally, place a thermometer in the fridge to check the actual temperature and adjust it based on the thermometer value.\\nOur détrempe is ready and has to rest until the next day. You cannot make croissants being in a rush. The détrempe has to rest in cold for at least 12 hours (at a suitable temperature, I insist). I have tried to make croissants the same day but the results are much worse.\\n7.30 pm – Shaping butter\\nBefore going to bed, you must give the butter the right shape and thickness to be able to laminate the next day. Before cooling the détrempe, weigh it in order to calculate the percentage of butter that you will need to laminate. In this case, my dough weighs 551 grams and I want to use 31% butter on the total weight: 551 x 31/100 = 171 g.\\n\\nJust before going to bed, my advice is to leave the kitchen windows open: the colder the kitchen is, the better! Working in a cold environment (less than 18 ºC) is one of the keys to success for laminating. When it comes to handling butter it has to stay cold at all times (that’s why it’s almost impossible to make croissants in the summer: the butter melts and it’s impossible to laminate properly!). I also recommend you to put blocks of ice in the freezer so you can place them the next day on your work surface in order to keep it cold between the folds. The best material to laminate is marble, because it keeps cold, but steel or wood also works. Later I’ll talk about the temperature and texture that should have the dough to start laminating.\\nDAY 2 – SUNDAY\\n8.00 am – Laminating: enclosing butter in the détrempe and first fold\\nThe détrempe has rested all night in the fridge and the butter is shaped. We can start laminating. As I have mentioned before, it is very important to work in a cold environment!\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What is the ideal texture of détrempe and butter befor laminating?\\nSome croissant recipes state that to laminate correctly the détrempe and the butter must be at the same temperature. Well, this not quite correct. We shouldn’t think in terms of temperature, but in terms of texture or plasticity. Now, for butter and détrempe to have the same texture, their temperature cannot be the same. Butter tends to heat faster than the dough, so the dough (which is the one that seals the butter) has to be colder. As a general rule, I work with a dough at 8 or 9 ºC and with a butter between 11 and 13 ºC. You should control the temperature at all times with an infrared thermometer, although it’s very important to feel it with your hands, especially the butter: it has to be cold, but malleable (i.e., you should be able to bend it without breaking it: this is plasticity). If the butter is too soft and hot, it will come out of the dough during laminating and will end up mixing to the dough instead of creating layers. If, on the other hand, the butter is too hard and cold, it will end up cracking and you won’t be able to create layers. If you see that the butter and/or the dough heat up too much, do not hesitate to interrupt the process and cool them down.\\n\\n9.00 am – Second fold\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 How many folds are needed for croissants?\\nAs a general rule, croissants are given 1 double fold and 1 single fold, or 3 single folds. Although the more folds, less volume, I always do 3 simple folds because it is more practical: I find it easier to extend the dough with a simple fold. The double fold requires more strength and we may apply too much pressure and break the layers of dough/butter.\\n\\n10.00 am – Third fold\\nRepeat the process indicated in the previous video, wrap the dough in plastic film and let it rest an hour or an hour and a half in the fridge.\\n11.30 – Cutting and shaping\\nWe have given the last fold and the dough has rested in the refrigerator (the last rest before shaping is longer, minimum one hour). Now we must rolling it out to cut the croissants before shaping.\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Straight or half-moon croissants?\\nThere is a debate among purists about whether the croissant should be straight or half-moon. According to experts, a butter croissant has a straight shape, while a half-moon croissant is made with shortening. However, in the past it was the other way around: shortening appeared almost a century after the croissant was invented, so originally the real butter croissant had a half-moon shape (hence its name). With modernization and global economy, it was more expensive to produce butter croissants, so the shortening croissants (which takes less space and is more profitable) invaded the market. I choose the straight shape because it is simpler: I only have to roll the dough on itself once cut into triangles. The half-moon shape requires more technique.\\n12.00 am – Proofing\\nOur croissants are shaped and need to proof. To do this, we must place them on a non-stick tray (or covered with baking paper), leaving enough space between each croissant.\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is it possible to freeze shaped croissants in order to proof them at a later time?\\nIt’s possible although as I’ve already told, freezing and yeast are not quite compatible. If you decide to freeze the croissants, you always have to do it after shaping and before proofing; just place them carefully inside a freezing bag tightly closed. Of course, you should not keep them long in the freezer, since yeast will end up dying. When you are ready to bake them, let them de-freeze before proofing.\\nProofing is a key point that requires time so we cannot be in a hurry. When we work with fermented doughs, we usually have the bad habit of wanting to accelerate the fermentation process (i.e. by placing the dough near a heat source or in a preheated oven). For croissants, I do not recommend it for a simple reason: we have spent time and effort in laminating the dough so that our croissants come out the best we can and we do not want excess heat to melt the butter and spoil all our work. As a general rule, croissants must ferment at a temperature between 21 ºC and 24 ºC (and a humidity rate of approx. 75-80%). For this, it is very useful to have a thermometer at home that indicates the temperature and humidity. Therefore, it is preferable to leave the croissants ferment at room temperature in the warmest room of the house (which is usually the kitchen). Or directly inside the oven (off and without preheating). If it is too cold in your house, you can try to leave the oven light on (the temperature will rise a few degrees), but always watching that it does not exceed the maximum fermentation temperature.\\nHumidity is harder to control. In dry environments, as we are not professionals and we do not have fermentation chambers, the only thing left for us is to create a humid environment ourselves. The most effective option I have found is to place a bowl of hot water (at about 70 ºC, warmed up with a kettle) in the oven’s sole (as far as possible from the tray where the croissants are). The croissants are left to ferment with the oven door closed, placing the thermometer inside to control the temperature and humidity at all times. The water does not get to heat the environment excessively (since it cools quickly), but the humidity increases.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 How do we know that croissants are proofed and ready to bake?\\nAs with bread, fermentation is one of the most difficult processes to control.\\nThe finger test that we usually use for the bread dough (light pressure with the fingertip on the surface to check if the dough has fermented correctly) does not work for croissants. After fermentation, the croissant dough is very delicate and it is better not to touch it. The test will have to be visual.\\n\\nThe proofing time will depend on the above mentioned factors and you will have to control the croissants, which more or less have to double their initial volume (not more). However, the biggest the croissant is after shaping (that is, the more rolls you have given on it), the more time it will take to ferment. In my case, the croissants fermented 3 hours at about 24 ºC and an approximate humidity of 80%.\\n3.00 pm – Baking\\nPreheat the oven to 190 °C (convection) for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, introduce the tray of the proofed croissants in the fridge. Cooling the proofed croissants before baking them help us to coat them with egg wash more easily without crushing them. On the other hand, the contrast between cold and heat will help development in the oven.\\nAfter 15 minutes, take the tray out of the fridge and give the croissants a coat of egg wash (either only with egg or with a mixture of yolk & cream or milk). During this operation it is very important to wash ONLY the smooth parts and avoid washing the layers (otherwise the egg will seal the layers preventing them from expanding correctly).\\nBake at 190 ºC between 17 and 20 minutes depending on the size of the croissants, taking care not to open the oven.\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is it necessary to produce steam in the oven to bake the croissants?\\nIt’s not. If your initial dough was rather dry, you may want to produce steam during the first 5 minutes of baking. But it’s general not necessary, especially if you have fermented the croissants in a humid environment as I mentioned earlier.\\nWhen the croissants are browned and ready, remove them from the oven and let them cool completely on top of a rack.\\n\\nHow to keep the croissants once baked?\\nHomemade croissants are best eaten when freshly baked! If you want to keep them fresh, place them in a wooden box covered with a clean cloth.\\nIf the next day they have dried a little, a few seconds in the microwave will make them crispy again. You can also toast them, they are delicious!\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nLearn from your mistakes: problems that may arise during the process\\nThe best way to get a good result is to practice.\\nWhen I enclose the butter in the dough and begin to laminate, the butter leaks:\\n– The butter is too soft (hot)\\n– The détrempe is too hot and does not chill the butter enough\\n– The pressure on the roller is too high\\nWhen extending the dough to make the folds, the dough shrinks and cannot be extended correctly:\\n– Excess kneading of the dough\\n– Lack of hydration of the dough\\n– Lack of rest of the dough between the folds\\n– The dough is too hot and has started to ferment\\nIn the oven, the croissants develop well at the beginning but they end up losing volume:\\n– Initial temperature of the oven too high: the croissants grow too much at the beginning, which prevents a uniform development\\n– Excess of fermentation of the croissants\\n– Yeast in poor condition\\nIn the oven, the butter melts and a puddle forms around the croissants:\\n– Incorrect laminating (probably due to a too soft and hot butter): instead of forming layers that retain moisture, butter has been integrated into the dough and melts in the oven\\n– Fermentation temperature too high, which has caused the butter to start melting\\n– Oven temperature too high\\n\\nBibliography\\n\\xa0\\n– Daniel Álvarez, Sweet Devotion: una visión actual de la bollería artesana\\xa0– Vilbo Ediciones, 2017\\n– JM Lanio, T.

      "You can always depend on this cake - it always turns out just right, with a zesty lemon flavour to boot. Olive oil means that it has a marvellous moist texture, even a day or two after cooking.We recently harvested over 700kg of olives from Carlo's family property and they have been cold pressed into a peppery olive oil. So it's the perfect time to make the luscious Tuscan ciambellone to eat with our coffee.In Australia it's often said that you don't cook with extra virgin olive oil - that you should use a lighter olive oil for cooking. But this cake is an exception to the rule, hence I always make it when our family-made Italian olive oil comes back from being pressed.Enjoy!Sioban Ciambellone Recipe (Italian Olive oil cake) Serves 8 Ingredients 2 x 50g eggs1 ¼ cups caster sugar¾ cup extra virgin olive oil¾ cup skim milkzest of 2 lemons and juice of 1 lemon1 ¼ cup plain flour1 heaped tsp baking powder (or 1 16 g sachet of lievito)¼ tsp baking soda (don’t add this if you have the lievito)dash of salticing sugar for dusting Method Preheat oven to 170° C and butter and flour a 9-inch round cake pan.In a large bowl, whisk eggs and sugar.Add olive oil, milk and lemon zest and juice and mix well.In a separate bowl, sift flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt (or 1 pack of lievito).Add to olive oil batter and stir just until smooth.Pour into prepared pan and bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until cooked.Let cake cool completely, then turn out onto a plate and dust with icing sugar.\n",

      "On Coquinaria are several historical recipes for puff pastry. On this page is a modern version. While I was searching online I saw some recipes for puff pastry that are actually just for flaky dough. Puff pastry is a kind of flaky dough, but to make puff pastry it takes something extra. Because just folding and rolling out several times flaky dough is not enough.\n",
      "Modern puff pastry is made with a lot of butter and without eggs, although the puff pastry from Lancelot de Casteau does contain eggs. The basic dough for puff pastry is made with butter, and during the first time the dough is rolled out, extra butter is added. The butter must remain visible in the dough. During the baking process the butter separates the dough into very thin layers. There are several methods to add the butter. The French method is (naturally) the most exquisite but also the most complicated. The German method is rather unwieldy, the Dutch method is more simple and handy, but of course my own method is not bad at all. The recipe below is inspired by the recipe for puff pastry by Glasse and Farley from the eighteenth and nineteenth century.\n",
      "In short\n",
      "\n",
      "French puff pastry – Make a flaky dough with 20% of the total weight of flour in butter, and let it rest for a half hour in the refrigerator. Then roll out the dough and put a large square lump of butter on it. Fold the dough over the butter and roll it out again. Fold in three and roll out once more. Fold again and let rest for a half hour.\n",
      "German puff pastry – Prepare a dough with just flour and water (let it rest for a half hour), and a second dough with 20% of the total weight of flour in butter. Roll out the water dough, roll out the butter dough (on baking paper), and put that on one half of the sheet of water dough. Fold the other half of the water dough over the butter dough and seal the edges with water. Roll out the dough, fold, let rest, et cetera.\n",
      "Dutch puff pastry – Make a flaky dough with 20% of the total weight of flour in butter, and let it rest for a half hour in the refrigerator. Then knead the rest of the butter in small pieces through the dough, take care that the butter pieces remain visible. Roll out, fold, let rest, et cetera.\n",
      "My puff pastry – Make a flaky dough with 20% of the total weight of flour in butter, and let it rest for a half hour in the refrigerator. Roll out the dough, and cover one half with thin slices of cold butter. Fold the other half of the dough over the butter. Roll out, fold, let rest, et cetera.\n",
      "\n",
      "My puff pastry recipe in detail\n",
      "\n",
      "250 gr (2 cups) sifted flour\n",
      "50 gr (3 Tbsp + 1 tsp) cold butter in small cubes\n",
      "½ tsp salt\n",
      "1⅜ dl ice cold water (137 gr)\n",
      "120 to 150 gr cold butter, thinly sliced\n",
      "Preparation\n",
      "Put the water in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes (especially during summer!).\n",
      "Sift the flour, dice the butter. I always add a little flour to the butter to prevent the lumps of butter sticking together.\n",
      "Knead flour, salt and water into a dough, than add the pieces of butter and knead again. The butter must remain visible. Cover the dough and let is rest for a half hour in the refrigerator.\n",
      "Sprinkle some flour on the worktop. Roll out the dough to a more or less rectangular sheet. Use a slicer or knife to cut thin slices from a stick of butter, and cover one half of the dough with them. Leave ½ to 1 inch (1 to 2 cm) free around the edges. Fold the other half over the butter slices, press the edges to seal the butter inside. Roll the dough out again, fold it and let rest, wrapped in plastic foil, in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.\n",
      "Then take the dough out again and roll out once more: first in one direction, fold, then in the other direction (at 90° angle). Repeat two more times.\n",
      "Puff pastry can be baked at high temperatures, as it does not contain any sugar (220 °C/430 °F or more). It takes about 20 minutes to bake puff pastry. This has consequences for the stuffing: it has to be done in that time too.\n",
      "Puff pastry dough is easy to freeze, but do that as a sheet, and not as a big round ball of dough.\n",

      "Basic Brioche Dough \n",
      "Here’s a standard brioche dough that will make twelve 1.6-ounce brioche à têtes, one single loaf, or a batch of cinnamon (a.k.a. “sticky”) buns. Start by putting into a bowl:\n",
      "2 tablespoons milk\n",
      "1 tablespoon sugar\n",
      "1/4 teaspoon instant yeast\n",
      "3 ounces all-purpose flour\n",
      "1 egg\n",
      "\n",
      "Stir all of it together withe a fork until the mixture is the consistency of a thick batter. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is your sponge. Use it right away or, for best flavor, make it a day ahead of time, let it ferment for an hour at room temperature then refrigerate it overnight. When you’re ready to prepare your dough scrape it into the bowl of an electric mixer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then whisk together a mixture of:\n",
      "6 ounces all-purpose flour\n",
      "2 tablespoons sugar\n",
      "1 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast\n",
      "1/2 teaspoon salt \n",
      "Like so:\n",
      "\n",
      "…and sprinkle over the sponge in the mixer bowl. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let it sit for 2 hours, 2 1/2 – 3 if the sponge was refrigerated. The dome of dry mix will crack as the sponge expands. It may even bubble through in a few spots. This is good. \n",
      "\n",
      "To mix, add two cold eggs and using the dough hook, beat the mixture for 2-3 minutes on medium speed. \n",
      "\n",
      "When it gets to looking like so…\n",
      "\n",
      "…start adding your butter. With the machine running, begin to add 4 ounces of very soft butter. If you want the brioche to rise high, say for a  large brioche loaf, go a little lighter, maybe 2 1/2 ounces. If you’re making something rich like cinnamon rolls, the full four ounces work great. For maximum flavor use an ounce or two of browned butter. Add it a tablespoon at a time, letting the dough absorb each addition before adding another, about two minutes of mixing per tablespoon of butter. \n",
      "\n",
      "Notice how light and sticky the dough gets. This is a terrific consistency for something like cinnamon rolls or têtes-de-brioche. Again if you want a higher-rising brioche, keep kneading the dough for another ten minutes or so to develop more structure (gluten). \n",
      "\n",
      "Once the dough is uniform (and it might take an extra bowl scraping or two), scrape it into a oiled bowl or rising container.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Let it rise another 1 1/2 hours until it looks about like so:\n",
      "\n",
      "Drape a piece of plastic wrap over it and deflate it by gently pressing down on it with your hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Put it into the refrigerator, letting it chill for a minimum of two hours, preferably overnight, to firm it (you’ll likely need to deflate it one more time after the first hour or so). For maximum flavor let it ripen for up to  three days in the fridge. It can be frozen for several months. \n",

      "To help guarantee success, I recommend reading through the recipe, watching the video tutorial, and reading the explanations below this recipe. (All answer many FAQs.) Do not use an electric mixer for this dough. It&#8217;s best if the dough is folded together with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula since it is so sticky. There is very minimal mixing required.Whisk the warm water, yeast, and 1 Tablespoon (6g) of sugar together in a large bowl. Cover and allow to rest until foamy on top, about 5 minutes. If the surface doesn&#8217;t have bubbles on top or look foamy after 15 minutes (it should if the yeast isn&#8217;t expired), start over with a fresh packet of yeast. Whisk in remaining sugar, the milk, egg, and salt. Once these wet ingredients are mixed together, lightly cover and set the bowl aside as you work on the next step.Cut the cold butter into 1/4 inch slices and add to a food processor or blender. Top with 2 and 1/2 cups flour. Pulse the mixture 12-15 times, until butter is crumbled into pea-size bits. See photo below for a visual. Using a food processor or blender is best for this dough. Keeping that in mind, if you don&#8217;t have one, you can use a pastry cutter to work in the butter.Pour the flour mixture into the wet yeast mixture. Very gently fold everything together using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Fold *just until* the dry ingredients are moistened. The butter must remain in pieces and crumbles, which creates a flaky pastry. Turn the sticky dough out onto a large piece of plastic wrap, parchment paper, aluminum foil, or into any container you can tightly cover.Wrap the dough/cover up tightly and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 48 hours.Take the dough out of the refrigerator to begin the “rolling and folding” process. If the dough sat for more than 4 hours, it may have slightly puffed up and that&#8217;s ok. (It will deflate as you shape it, which is also ok.) Very generously flour a work surface. The dough is very sticky, so make sure you have more flour nearby as you roll and fold. Using the palm of your hands, gently flatten the dough into a small square. Using a rolling pin, roll out into a 15&#215;8 inch rectangle. When needed, flour the work surface and dough as you are rolling. Fold the dough into thirds as if it were a business letter. (See photos and video tutorial.) Turn it clockwise and roll it out into a 15 inch long rectangle again. Then, fold into thirds again. Turn it clockwise. You’ll repeat rolling and folding 1 more time for a total of 3 times.Wrap up/seal tightly and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. You can also freeze the dough at this point. See freezing instructions.Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Rimmed baking sheets are best because butter may leak from the dough as it bakes. If you don&#8217;t have rimmed baking sheets, when it&#8217;s time to preheat the oven, place another baking sheet on the oven rack below to catch any butter that may drip.Take the dough out of the refrigerator and cut it in half. Wrap 1 half up and keep refrigerated as you work with the first half. (You can freeze half of the dough at this point, use the freezing instructions below.)On a floured work surface, roll dough out into a 12&#215;8 inch rectangle. You can roll out the dough on a lightly floured piece of parchment paper or lightly floured silicone baking mat instead because you will transfer the shaped dough to a lined baking sheet next.Using a sharp knife, cut off two corners of the dough (on one 8-inch side) and then two small triangles 3 inches apart from each other on the other end (the other 8-inch side). See visual below.Spread 1/2 of the filling (raspberry or cream cheese) down the length of the center of the strip, which should be about 3 inches wide. Using a sharp knife, pastry wheel, or pizza cutter, cut 10 slanting strips (3/4 &#8211; 1 inch wide each) along both sides. Fold strips over filling, alternating each side to resemble a twist or a braid. Fold the bottom end up to seal the filling inside. Repeat with the second half of the dough and the rest of the filling. The braids may seem very narrow, but they puff up and out as they bake.Whisk the egg wash ingredients together. Brush all over the dough.I strongly recommend refrigerating the shaped braids before baking for at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour before baking. The braids tend to leak more butter and/or lose more shape if they haven&#8217;t chilled.Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C).Bake each braid for 18-22 minutes or until golden brown. Some butter may leak from the dough, that&#8217;s completely normal and expected. Feel free to remove the baking sheets from the oven halfway through baking and brush the dough with any of the leaking butter, then place back in the oven to finish baking. (That&#8217;s what I do!)Remove baked danish braids from the oven and cool for at least 5 minutes before cutting and serving.\n",

      "Make the dough: Stir yeast, water, and 1 teaspoon sugar in a bowl. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Butter a large bowl; set aside. Put bread flour, all-purpose flour, remaining 3 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons sugar, and the salt into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the dough hook; mix on low speed until combined. Add yeast mixture, milk, and butter; mix until dough just comes together.Knead dough: Scrape dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Using lightly floured hands, knead until smooth, about 3 minutes. Transfer to buttered bowl, turning to coat.Let dough rise: Cover dough with plastic wrap; transfer to the refrigerator. Let rise until doubled in bulk, about 2 hours (dough should not spring back when you press it with your finger).Make the butter package: About 45 minutes after the dough begins rising, put flour and butter into the clean bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium speeduntil well combined, 3 to 4 minutes. Scrape butter mixture out onto a piece of parchment paper; shape into a rectangle. Top with parchment, and roll out to an 8-by-10-inch rectangle. Transfer to a baking sheet, and refrigerate 30 minutes.Roll out dough: Turn out dough onto a lightly floured work surface; shape into a rectangle. Roll out to a 10 1/2-by-16-inch rectangle, about 1/2 inch thick, with short side facing you.Place butter package on dough: The butter package should be cool but pliable; your finger should leave an indentation but the butter should still hold its shape. If too soft, continue to refrigerate; if too firm, let stand at room temperature briefly. Place horizontally on bottom half of dough; remove parchment. Fold top half of dough over butter package, and pinch edges of dough to seal.Roll in butter: Turn dough so that a short side is facing you and the seam is on the right. Roll out to a 10-by-20-inch rectangle, about 1/2 inch thick (keep the corners as square as possible).Fold dough into thirds: Remove any excess flour with a pastry brush. Starting at the far end, fold rectangle in thirds as you would a business letter (this completes the first of 3 \"turns\").Mark dough: Mark the dough with your knuckle (later, this will help you remember how many turns have been completed). Wrap dough in plastic, and refrigerate 1 hour.Repeat process: Remove from refrigerator, and press the dough; it should be pliable but have some resistance. If too soft, return to refrigerator; if too firm, let stand at room temperature, 5 minutes. Repeat the preceding three steps to complete two more turns (make 2 marks for the second turn and 3 marks for the third turn); always start with a short side facing you and the seam on the right, rolling lengthwise before crosswise. After the second turn, wrap dough in plastic, and refrigerate 1 hour. After the third and final turn, wrap dough in plastic, and refrigerate 8 hours (or overnight).Roll out and chill dough: Turn out dough onto a lightly floured work surface, and roll out to a 30-by-16-inch rectangle. If dough becomes unmanageable, cut in half crosswise, and roll out two 15-by-16-inch rectangles (refrigerate 1 piece as you work with the other). Chill in freezer 15 minutes. Remove dough, and remeasure: It should match original dimensions; if not, roll out again. If dough becomes too warm or elastic, chill in freezer, 15 minutes.Cut dough: Cut dough into two 30-by-8-inch rectangles (or four 15-by-8-inch rectangles). Stack rectangles, lining up edges (if you have four smaller rectangles, make two stacks).Trim dough and cut into triangles: Using a pastry or pizza wheel and cutting at a 20-degree angle, trim a small wedge from one short side to create an angled side. Cut dough into triangles, each with a 4 1/2-inch base. You should have about 20 total.Cut slits: Cut a 1-inch slit in the middle of the base of each triangle. Separate the stacks, transferring half the triangles to a parchment-lined baking sheet; cover, and refrigerate.Begin shaping croissants: Working with one triangle at a time and keeping remaining triangles covered with a clean kitchen towel, hold the two corners of the base, and stretch to lengthen it slightly. Grasp inner corners formed by the slit in the base, and lift and stretch them toward the outer sides of the triangle; press to seal.Roll croissants: Using your fingertips, roll the base of the triangle up and away from you, stretching the dough slightly outward as you roll to elongate the point (when finished, the point should be tucked under the croissant).Finish shaping croissants: Bend the two ends toward you to form a crescent shape (the ends should almost touch). Transfer to parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing croissants 2 inches apart. Repeat with remaining triangles. Cover loosely with plastic wrap, and let stand in a warm place until croissants have doubled in bulk and are very soft, 1 1/2 hours to 2 1/4 hours, depending on the temperature of room.Brush with egg: Preheat oven to 400 degrees, with racks in upper and lower thirds. Brush tops of croissants with egg. Bake, rotating sheets halfway through, until croissants are puffed and golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool slightly on sheets on wire racks. Serve warm or at room temperature.\n",

      "Listen to this: My editor at Bazaar took me out to lunch before the holidays and congratulated me for eating the bread out of the bread basket that was placed on the table while we waited for our meal. (The chewy, delicious bread, I might add, though I would have eaten it even if it hadn't been good, because I am a human and it was lunchtime and I was hungry.)\n",
      "She.\n",
      "Congratulated.\n",
      "Me.\n",
      "She ate the bread, too, mind. It's just that she's the only person she knows - besides me now, I guess - who still actually eats bread. And pasta. And springs for two courses on a business lunch. Sigh.\n",
      "You all know I like a good New Year's resolution as much as the next person. I'm all about fresh starts and good intentions, I really am. Why, just the other day I ordered a ginger-apple-carrot juice with breakfast myself! But when congratulations are offered on eating a piece of bread, for the love of Pete, I feel like this whole cleanse/no-carb/juice/detox mania has officially reached crazy-making levels. (Exhibit A: Elevating Adaptogenic Latte. What?) And while I'm at it: can we once and for all get rid of the term \"clean eating\"? It makes my head hurt.\n",
      "So, in light of all of this, I've decided to post a second recipe for cake in one week. I feel like it's my civic duty or something.\n",
      "Without further ado: Ciambellone! (chahm-bell-ohn-eh) Also known as the only cake my mother knows how to make. (More or less.)\n",
      "Ciambellone is a sunny, simple tube cake made with yogurt and lemon peel. It's tender and fragrant, has a good, sensible crumb, lasts for a few days on the kitchen counter, is not-too-sweet, easy to make, and very nice for breakfast (with a glass of green juice or without). It's also good at teatime and as a snack for little children. In other words, it's a perfect everyday cake.\n",
      "(Other perfect everyday cakes: Catherine Newman's Donut Cake, Deborah Madison's Poppyseed Cake and Alice Medrich's Kamut Pound Cake, all of which I adore passionately and do not make nearly enough. I blame that thing I'm working on. On my to-make-soon list, though, is Molly's whole-wheat riff on an Edna Lewis cake, which looks right up my alley. Consider it my New Year's resolution!)\n",
      "I suspect you will be relieved to know that ciambellone does not require confectioners' sugar on top or an icing of any kind or new-fangled additions to the batter. It is simplicity itself, wholesomeness incarnate. But most of all, it's just a happy-making little thing. Which makes it just right for gray, old January. Or any other month out of the year.\n",
      "Three cheers for cake!\n",

      "The 3rd February is the feast day of Armenian San Biagio (Saint Blaise).  He was a hermit who was fed by the animals of a nearby forest and who he, in turn, fed when they were ill. His fame stems from melting a fishbone that had stuck in a child’s throat and he’s now the patron saint of throat afflictions. He’s more often than not depicted with wild animals in frescos in churches but sometimes as a pair of wool combs as he died rather nastily by these tearing him apart to “earn” his martyrdom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course it is no coincidence that his miracle is celebrated in February. The original meaning of February stems from the Latin for fever, febris, and it’s this time of year that the Romans had their februa ‘purifying’ festival. This built on the idea that fevers were positive, a purifying test, and if you got through you’d be all set for sunny spring. Numa Pompilius, King of Rome in c700bc built this purification festival into a month when 10 months became 12 in the Roman calendar.\n",
      "Yesterday evening our Italian teacher’s mamma kindly sent us these Ciambella di S. Biagio to start the day with; children are expected to eat a whole one in protection for the coming year.  If they are really diligent and make it to church, olio santo, the best of the oil from the previous harvest which is still given to the local priest and used in blessings is rubbed onto the adam’s apple.\n",

      "First, start by hydrating the yeast by stirring it with the warm milk in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Let stand for 8 minutes.Add the flour and salt, and mix together on low until you get a dry, shaggy mixture.Add the eggs, one at a time, along with the sugar, beating between each addition.Switch to the dough hook attachment and beat the dough until you get a smooth dough and the bowl is clean (scrape down the dry bits stuck to the sides as you go to be sure that all the ingredients get incorporated into the dough). This will take about 3 to 4 minutes.Switch back to the paddle and dump in all the butter, and beat it into the dough. The dough will break down and become sticky and messy, but when it starts to form a more cohesive mass, switch back to the dough hook and beat on low (speed 2 on a KitchenAid mixer) for about 10 minutes or so, or until the dough is smooth and elastic, and the bowl is clean again.Butter a bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl. Cover with saran wrap. Let rise on the counter until it has doubled (I left mine for almost 3 hours), then punch it down to deflate, cover, and leave in the fridge overnight.The next morning, divide the dough into 8 pieces, and quickly roll them on the counter to make dough balls. Don’t work the dough too long or you risk melting the butter. Butter 8 slots of a muffin tin and place a dough ball in each. Place the muffin pan on a rimmed baking sheet and cover with a sheet of waxed paper. Put the sheet in the oven (turned off!) with just the light on. Let the dough balls rise until they have doubled (about 1.5 hours). When the dough has doubled, take the pan out of the oven and set it on the counter while you preheat the oven to 400ºF.Meanwhile, mix the egg with 1 tsp water and brush lightly onto each bun (there will be leftover egg wash—you don’t need to use it all). When the oven is preheated, bake for 15–20 minutes, until the tops are a deep golden brown. Let cool 10 minutes before unmolding. Serve warm with homemade jam or marmalade, and more butter, if you dare.\n",

      "Here is a classic fall recipe with a twist. I’ve added the tartness of pomegranate seeds to the mellow sweetness of pears and draped the whole thing in a rich, buttery, tender brioche dough. It is a lovely and quick dessert, especially if you have a bucket of brioche on hand. For those of you who do not already own The New Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day, here is the recipe and it can be used for all of these wonderful treats: caramel sticky buns, grilled fruit tart, fresh fruit muffins, Brioche à tête, apricot pastries and fabulous doughnuts! Actually the possibilities are endless, just use your imagination and let us know what treats you’ve come up with.\n",
      "Brioche Dough (makes about 4 loaves)\n",
      "\n",
      "1 1/2 cups (340g) lukewarm water\n",
      "1 tablespoon Red Star Platinum, Active Dry, or Quick-Rise yeast (1 packet)\n",
      "1 tablespoon kosher salt\n",
      "8 large eggs at room temperature, lightly beaten\n",
      "1/2 cup (170g) honey\n",
      "1 1/2 cups (340g) unsalted butter, melted\n",
      "7 1/2 cups (1065g) unbleached all-purpose flour\n",
      "Mix the yeast, salt, eggs honey and melted butter with the water in a 5-quart bowl, or lidded (not airtight) food container.\n",
      "Mix in the flour, using a spoon until all of the flour is incorporated.\n",
      "Cover (not airtight), and allow to sit at room temperature for about two hours. Note: Sometimes with brioche, with so much cold egg, if you don’t use warm enough water, the initial rise can be very slow. Professionals would fix this by letting the eggs come to room temperature, which solves the problem. You can do that, or just make sure that your final mixture of egg/butter/water is nice and warm (but not hot, or you can kill the yeast).\n",
      "The dough can be used as soon as it is chilled. This dough is way too sticky to use after the initial rise, but once it is chilled it is very easy to handle. It can be used to create the Tatin or any of these brioche recipes: caramel sticky buns, grilled fruit tart, Fresh Fruit Muffins, Brioche à tête, apricot pastries and fabulous doughnuts! The dough can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. After that you can freeze the dough.\n",

      "Pour cold water into a small dish with a few pieces of ice to chill. There are two ways to integrate the butter into the dry ingredients… by hand mixing or with a food processor. In my experience, both methods work equally well as long as you mix the water in by hand. Don't process the water into the dough, or you'll end up with a tough crust. BREAK UP BUTTER BY HAND: Add flour and salt to a large mixing bowl, stir with a fork to blend. Take cold butter out of the refrigerator and add it to the bowl. Use a pastry cutter to cut the cold butter into the flour, using firm pressure and pushing down repeatedly to break the butter into small pieces. Work as quickly as you comfortably can. Stop when the flour and butter mixture looks like large-curd cottage cheese. There should be a variety of sizes in the butter pieces… the largest should be about the size of a pea. Place flour and butter mixture in the freezer for 2 minutes before proceeding. MIXING DOUGH WITH FOOD PROCESSOR: Fit your processor with a blade attachment. Add flour and salt to the food processor. Take cold butter out of the refrigerator and add it to the processor. Pulse the processor in 3-second bursts to break up the butter. Stop when the flour and butter mixture looks like large-curd cottage cheese. There should be a variety of sizes in the butter pieces… the largest should be about the size of a pea. It should only take 10-12 pulses to get the right consistency; start checking consistency after 8 pulses. Make sure you don’t over-process… having a variety of sizes in the butter chunks will make a flakier dough. Mixture should hold together when squeezed in your hand. Pour mixture into a mixing bowl. Place flour and butter mixture in the freezer for 2 minutes before proceeding. Take ice water out of the refrigerator. Add water to the flour mixture one tablespoonful at a time, using a fork to lightly toss the liquid into the dough. Try not to touch the dough as you mix; you want the mixture to stay as cool as possible. You may not need all the liquid to bring the dough together, so add slowly… the dough can easily turn wet and sticky if you’re not careful. By the same token, you may need a bit more liquid. Pie dough is not an exact science; every batch of dough will be different. When the dough begins to look stringy and larger lumps begin to form, take a fistful of the dough and squeeze it in your palm. Open your palm. If the dough holds together well and is just slightly tacky, it’s ready to pull into a dough ball. If the dough easily crumbles in your hand or falls apart, it is still too dry… add a little more liquid. When dough is ready, pull it together with your hands into two balls, one slightly larger than the other. Flatten the balls into disks that are 7-8 inches across. Cover the disks tightly in plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator immediately. The dough should be refrigerated for at least 1 hour, and up to 48 hours. I prefer to make the dough a day ahead and refrigerate it overnight. You can also freeze the dough for up to 3 months. If you freeze the dough, allow it to thaw and soften a bit before rolling out. TO ROLL OUT CRUSTS: Any large, smooth surface will work, as long as it is in a cool dry area. Marble is ideal. You will need to work quickly to roll out the dough-- again, you want it to stay cool, so have any tools you need nearby and ready to go: rolling pin, flour, pastry scraper, 9” pie plate or dish, a sharp knife, and a baking sheet (as needed). Lightly flour your rolling surface. Take the larger of the two dough disks out of the refrigerator and discard the plastic wrap.  Place it in the center of your rolling surface and sprinkle the top of the disk lightly with flour. Use your rolling pin to roll out the dough. I like to roll it from the center outward, a roll in each direction, as though I’m rolling around the face of a clock (12, 3, 6, 9, 12). You want the dough to expand evenly in all directions, so that it forms a large circular shape. Use more pressure in the center of the dough, and less as you near the edges. Don’t roll past the edge of the dough. As you roll, you may notice cracks forming on the outer edges. If any large cracks develop, pause and pinch the dough together to mend them before rolling again. If the dough becomes sticky as you roll, lightly re-flour the surface of the dough before proceeding. When the dough is about halfway rolled out, use a pastry scraper to loosen the dough from the board and flip it over. Re-flour the board before positioning the dough in the center again. Continue to roll out the dough in the same way as before. You want the dough to end up about 1/8” thick, and as round as possible. As you roll it out, you should see a marbled effect to the dough where patches of butter have formed. This is a good thing—those pockets of butter are what make the crust flaky. Rolling out pie dough swiftly and efficiently takes practice. You may find that your dough is getting too soft, or the butter pieces are melting, as you roll. A little stickiness can be remedied by a sprinkle of flour, but if the dough is getting warm or the fat is melting you’ll need to re-chill the dough before proceeding.&nbsp; Use the pastry scraper to loosen the dough from the board and place it on a baking sheet. Place the baking sheet in the freezer for 1-2 minutes to re-chill the dough. Continue rolling out. When the dough is about 1/8” thick all the way around, take your pie dish or plate and center it in the middle of the dough. The dough will need to extend about 2 inches past the edge of the dish. Use a sharp knife to cut any rough edges off to form a smooth 2-inch circle around the outer edge of the pie dish. Use the pastry scraper to loosen the dough from the rolling surface. Gently fold the dough in quarters. Pick it up and place it in the pie dish, centering the point of the fold in the middle of the dish. Unfold the dough and let it gently settle into the pie dish, lifting the edges of the dough and letting gravity pull it down into the corners. Do not stretch the dough to fit the plate; let it settle naturally, or you’ll end up with a leaky bottom crust. Adjust the dough as needed to keep it as centered as possible in the dish. Alternatively, you can transfer the crust to the dish by rolling it around the rolling pin and unrolling it over the pie dish. I prefer folding it, since it’s easier for me to center in the dish that way, but either method works. When the pie dish has been lined with dough, place it in the refrigerator to chill. Take the smaller of the two dough disks out of the refrigerator and roll it out the same way as you did the first. When trimming the edges, the dough only needs to extend about 1 inch beyond the edge of the pie dish. Re-chill on the baking sheet after rolling out, if necessary. This will be your top crust. Assemble your pie by filling the lower crust with your filling...&nbsp; ...dot the filling with butter, if the recipe requires it... ...then lay the top crust gently over the top of the pie. Center the top crust as much as possible over the top of the dish. Trim the edges of both crusts so that they are a little less than 1/2 inch beyond the rim of the pie dish. Roll the lower crust over the top of the upper crust and pinch gently to form a lip or edge to the crust.&nbsp; Work your way around the pie, rolling and pinching, until the circle is completed. Finish your edges by scalloping or crimping them with a fork. I like to scallop the crust by using the forefinger of one hand to make a crease, then pinching around the crease with the thumb and forefinger of the other hand. I work my way around the inner edge of the pie first making creases, then I finish it by working around the outer edge, scalloping in the opposite direction. Chill the fully assembled pie for at least 10 minutes before baking. Make an egg or milk wash and brush on the upper crust for a nicely browned finish (optional). Milk washes can be a bit uneven, so I prefer an egg wash-- use an egg yolk whisked together with 1 tsp of water. This will give it a nice golden sheen. Cut slits in the upper crust to vent (after the wash, not before),&nbsp;and sprinkle the top of the pie with sugar, if desired. I sometimes like to sprinkle it with turbinado sugar to add a light candy-like crunch and a little sparkle. Bake pie according to recipe directions. During the baking process, I usually turn the pie 180 degrees about halfway through the cooking time to make sure the crust browns evenly (ovens can be hotter in the back than in the front-- this allows for more even heat distribution). If these instructions are followed carefully, you should end up with a flavorful, flaky pie crust! Happy baking. :)\n",

      "If you do not have a food processor, put the butter into the bowl and mix it lightly with the flour using a fork. Then, roll a pastry blade across the butter and flour using a back and forth motion. Keep lifting and rocking the pastry blade until you have a rough, crumbly texture.

      "If you are using a bowl, lightly pat the dough down with your hands, then make a small well in the center. Pour the water into the well and mix with a fork until the dough starts to come away from the sides of the bowl.Cover the dough with plastic wrap and put it into the refrigerator for 20 minutes. This gives the butter time to cool back down, and prevents your dough from becoming too soft. After 20 minutes are up, take the dough out and unwrap it.Lightly flour your cutting board and rolling pin. This prevents the dough from sticking to everything. Be sure to keep a bag of flour on hand, in case you have to add more flour to your work surface; the dough will absorb the flour as you work with it, making the work surface sticky.Turn the dough onto the cutting board. The dough may feel dry, but this is normal. Do not add water to it; it will become softer the more you work with it.Form the dough into a flat square by kneading it gently. Do not make the dough too thin; you will be rolling it out some more later. You may see some streaks of butter in the dough, which is also normal. Do not attempt to mix the butter in.Use the rolling pin to roll the dough out into a rectangle. Roll in one direction only. The dough should be three times longer than it is wide.Fold the dough into thirds. Take the bottom third of the rectangle, and fold it just past the middle. Take the upper third of the rectangle and fold it down on top of the rest of the dough, making a square.Rotate the dough 90 degrees to either side. It does not matter which side: left or right. If the dough does not turn easily, it means that it has begun to stick to the cutting board. Gently lift it up and spread some more flour down onto the board. Set the dough back down and try rotating it again.Repeat the rolling, folding, and turning process six to seven more times. In this way, you are creating thin layers in the dough.Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and put it in the refrigerator. Leave it in there for at least one hour, or overnight.Use the dough. Once the dough has thoroughly chilled, you can take it out of the refrigerator, roll it out, and use it to make croissants, filled pastry bites, or even baked brie cheese.\n",

      "Thanks to October’s Daring Bakers Challenge I was finally able to task myself to make some homemade Puff Pastry. I’ve been wanting to do it for so long now, but never really felt inspired to commit myself to the tedious affair that is laminated dough… But I am SO happy that I finally have! Because now I know that it really isn’t that tedious. I mean, it’s not like throwing together a batch of cookies by any means, but I’ve definitely made more difficult things. I’ve learned that the active time for making puff pastry is not very much. It’s mostly all about having the patience to wait around to fold and roll out the dough between multiple long, chilling periods.\n",
      "If you are not familiar with puff pastry, I think it is really important that I fill you in on how it works. You know, scientifically and all.\n",
      "Puff pastry is similar to croissant and danish dough in that they are referred to as laminated (layered) dough. The difference being that puff pastry dough isn’t yeasted. It relies solely on the steam from the butter upon melting to create the flakiness between layers. These layers are created by encasing butter in dough, then rolling it out and folding it over and over again to create hundreds of layers in the final product. I’ll explain some more as I walk you through the steps.\n",

      "This particular recipe comes from Cooks Illustrated (my old faithful!). They use a very basic lean dough that uses lemon juice for what I can only imagine is to tenderize the dough… kind of like vinegar in a pie crust? That’s my guess at least. Some puff pastry recipes have you cut in some butter too- this recipe doesn’t. The dough comes together easily in a food processor. First you process to evenly disburse the dry ingredients, then with the food processor running you add the lemon juice and 3/4 cup water. You use the remaining 1/4 cup of water as needed to produce a dough that has no floury bits remaining.\n",

      "I didn’t want to over-process my dough, so as soon as I used the full cup I pretty much stopped the food processor. I was left with some serious dry spots and some overly gummy, wet spots. I probably should have let it run until it was even but I didn’t realize it until I started to shape the dough and by then it was too late. But the good news is that between all the folding and rolling with the butter later on, all the dry pieces eventually went away. Anyways, I would just recommend that you watch out and make sure your dough is homogenous. I am sure you could also use a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment instead of the food processor. I think I’ll do that next time. I never have any luck with food processor’s distributing liquid evenly (particularly with pie crusts).\n",

      " Meanwhile, make the butter block. The butter block plays a very important role in puff pastry and has many guidelines to follow when constructing. The butter must be chilled when you make the butter block. You want the butter block to always remain chilled so that it doesn’t melt into the layers during the rolling process and become part of the dough. It must also be flexible so it will effortlessly expand into a longer and thinner layer when rolled, rather than breaking into pieces. That is why the chilling time between folds and rolls is so important, it helps you maintain the proper temperature and consistency for the butter.\n",

      "There are 2 techniques to making a butter block.

OR you can choose the much easier method of using a stand mixer. Cut the cold butter into pieces, toss it with flour in the bowl of a stand mixer, and beat it with the paddle for 1 to 2 minutes, just until smooth and blended. You can then shape out the 8″ square on some plastic wrap, cover it, and refrigerate for one hour.\n",

      "From the kitchen of One Perfect Bite...I had some fun testing recipes for the Italian Easter Bread that's called Ciambellone. I'm not going to talk about the two recipes that failed, other than to say my evil eye is now trained on the developers and, once they recover, they'll get with the program and do a better job. I am happy to report that I did find a workable recipe. This link,  Chef's Line , will take you to a pod cast that demonstrates exactly how Easter Bread is made.  Ciambellone falls somewhere between a cake and bread on the culinary periodic table. It tastes like soft biscotti and that, of course, makes it perfect to serve with coffee or tea. It also requires no special equipment to make. Flour is piled onto an immaculately clean board and the remainder of the ingredients are added to a fist-made well and mixed into the flour using your equally immaculate fingers. It's then formed into rings and baked. I prefer to make one large ring and use a ring mold to enhance the appearance of the Ciambellone. The recipe appears below the next photo.I also want to share a great recipe for  Soft Sugar Cookies with you. It comes from Denise at Cottage Sisters. I stumbled on it while searching for the Italian Easter Bread. She was kind enough to share the recipe and photo with me so I could pass them on to you. I hope you'll take a look at her fabulous site.Photo courtesy of Cottage SistersCiambellone - Italian Easter Bread...from the kitchen of One Perfect Bite, courtesy of Kitchen Guy at Chef's LineIngredients:4 cups flour3 large eggs1 teaspoon vanilla1 cup granulated sugar1 cup milk1 teaspoon cinnamon1/2 cup vegetable oil or melted butter1 teaspoon baking powder1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest1 egg for egg washConfectioners' sugar for dustingDirections:1) Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour a large baking sheet or a 9-inch tube pan. Set aside.2) Mound flour on a board. Create a well in center of mound. Using your fingers, begin alternating liquid and other dry ingredients into well, mixing until all  ingredients are combined. Knead, adding additional flour if needed, to form a smooth dough.3) Divide into one or two parts and shape into fat rings. Beat additional egg with a teaspoon of water. Brush top of ring with egg wash. Place on baking sheet or into tube pan. Bake 40 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool. Dust with confectioners' sugar.
